Version 3.0.0 was released on September 23, 2019.[[14]](#cite_note-14) With .NET Core 3, the framework supports development of desktop [application software](/wiki/Application_software \"Application software\"), [artificial intelligence](/wiki/Artificial_intelligence \"Artificial intelligence\")/[machine learning](/wiki/Machine_learning \"Machine learning\") and [IoT](/wiki/Internet_of_things \"Internet of things\") apps.[[15]](#cite_note-15)[_[failed verification](/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability \"Wikipedia:Verifiability\")_]\n\nThe next release after .NET Core 3.1 will be .NET 5\\. The [.NET Framework](/wiki/.NET_Framework \".NET Framework\") will not receive any further major versions, and .NET 5 will be the only .NET meant for new applications going forward – hence the removal of the \"Core\" branding and skipping of version 4 to avoid confusion with the .NET Framework 4.x.[[16]](#cite_note-:3-16) The first preview of .NET 5 was released on March 16, 2020.[[17]](#cite_note-17)\n\n.NET Core 2.1 and later, i.e. including .NET 5, supports [Alpine Linux](/wiki/Alpine_Linux \"Alpine Linux\") (i.e. [musl](/wiki/Musl \"Musl\") libc it uses[[24]](#cite_note-24)).[[25]](#cite_note-25)\n\n## Language support[[edit](/w/index.php?title=.NET_Core&action=edit§ion=2 \"Edit section: Language support\")]\n\n\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/Dotnet-bot.svg/220px-Dotnet-bot.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Dotnet-bot.svg)\n\n\n\n[](/wiki/File:Dotnet-bot.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\ndotnet-bot, the community mascot for .NET\n\n\n\n\n\n.NET Core fully supports [C#](/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language) \"C Sharp (programming language)\") and [F#](/wiki/F_Sharp_(programming_language) \"F Sharp (programming language)\") (and [C++/CLI](/wiki/C%2B%2B/CLI \"C++/CLI\") as of 3.1; only enabled on Windows) and supports [Visual Basic .NET](/wiki/Visual_Basic_.NET \"Visual Basic .NET\") (for version 15.5 in .NET Core 5.0.100-preview.4, and some old versions supported in old .NET Core).\n\nVB.NET compiles and runs on .NET Core, but as of .NET Core 3.1, the separate Visual Basic Runtime is not implemented. Microsoft initially announced that .NET Core 3 would include the Visual Basic Runtime, but after two years the timeline for such support was updated to .NET 5.[[26]](#cite_note-26)[[27]](#cite_note-27)\n\n## Architecture[[edit](/w/index.php?title=.NET_Core&action=edit§ion=3 \"Edit section: Architecture\")]\n\n.NET Core supports four [cross-platform](/wiki/Cross-platform \"Cross-platform\") scenarios: [ASP.NET Core](/wiki/ASP.NET_Core \"ASP.NET Core\") [web apps](/wiki/Web_app \"Web app\"); command-line apps; libraries; and [Universal Windows Platform apps](/wiki/Universal_Windows_Platform_apps \"Universal Windows Platform apps\"). Prior to .NET Core 3.0, it did not implement [Windows Forms](/wiki/Windows_Forms \"Windows Forms\") or [Windows Presentation Foundation](/wiki/Windows_Presentation_Foundation \"Windows Presentation Foundation\") (WPF), which render the standard [GUI](/wiki/GUI \"GUI\") for desktop software on Windows.[[28]](#cite_note-Cater2016-28)[[29]](#cite_note-Schmelzer_on_.NET_2015-29) Now, however, .NET Core 3 supports desktop technologies Windows Forms, WPF, and [Universal Windows Platform](/wiki/Universal_Windows_Platform \"Universal Windows Platform\") (UWP).[[30]](#cite_note-Lander2018-30)\n\n.NET Core supports use of [NuGet](/wiki/NuGet \"NuGet\") packages. Unlike [.NET Framework](/wiki/.NET_Framework \".NET Framework\"), which is serviced using [Windows Update](/wiki/Windows_Update \"Windows Update\"), .NET Core relies on its [package manager](/wiki/Package_manager \"Package manager\") to receive updates.[[28]](#cite_note-Cater2016-28)[[29]](#cite_note-Schmelzer_on_.NET_2015-29)\n\nThe two main components of .NET Core are CoreCLR and CoreFX, respectively, which are comparable to the [Common Language Runtime](/wiki/Common_Language_Runtime \"Common Language Runtime\") (CLR) and the [Framework Class Library](/wiki/Framework_Class_Library \"Framework Class Library\") (FCL) of the [.NET Framework](/wiki/.NET_Framework \".NET Framework\")'s [Common Language Infrastructure](/wiki/Common_Language_Infrastructure \"Common Language Infrastructure\") (CLI) implementation.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nAs a CLI implementation of [Virtual Execution System](/wiki/Virtual_Execution_System \"Virtual Execution System\") (VES), CoreCLR is a complete [runtime](/wiki/Runtime_system \"Runtime system\") and [virtual machine](/wiki/Virtual_machine \"Virtual machine\") for [managed](/wiki/Managed_code \"Managed code\") [execution](/wiki/Execution_(computing) \"Execution (computing)\") of .NET programs and includes a [just-in-time compiler](/wiki/Just-in-time_compiler \"Just-in-time compiler\") called RyuJIT.[[31]](#cite_note-31)[[a]](#cite_note-33) .NET Core also contains CoreRT, the .NET Native runtime optimized to be integrated into [AOT](/wiki/Ahead-of-time_compilation \"Ahead-of-time compilation\") compiled native [binaries](/wiki/Executable \"Executable\").[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nAs a CLI implementation of the foundational [Standard Libraries](/wiki/Standard_Libraries_(CLI) \"Standard Libraries (CLI)\"),[[33]](#cite_note-34) CoreFX shares a subset of .NET Framework APIs, however, it also comes with its own APIs that are not part of the .NET Framework.[[28]](#cite_note-Cater2016-28) A variant of the .NET Core [library](/wiki/Library_(computing) \"Library (computing)\") is used for [UWP](/wiki/Universal_Windows_Platform \"Universal Windows Platform\").[[34]](#cite_note-35)\n\nThe .NET Core [command-line interface](/wiki/Command-line_interface \"Command-line interface\") offers an execution entry point for [operating systems](/wiki/Operating_system \"Operating system\") and provides developer services like compilation and package management.[[35]](#cite_note-36)\n\n## Notes[[edit](/w/index.php?title=.NET_Core&action=edit§ion=4 \"Edit section: Notes\")]\n\n\n\n\n\n1.  **[^](#cite_ref-33 \"Jump up\")** The prefix \"Ryu\" is the Japanese word for \"dragon\" (竜, _ryū_), and is a reference to the book _[Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools](/wiki/Compilers:_Principles,_Techniques,_and_Tools \"Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools\")_ (commonly known as the dragon book, from an early cover design), as well as to a character from the video game _[Street Fighter](/wiki/Street_Fighter \"Street Fighter\")_.[[32]](#cite_note-32)\n\n\n\n\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=.NET_Core&action=edit§ion=5 \"Edit section: References\")]\n\n\n\n\n\n1.  **[^](#cite_ref-1 \"Jump up\")** [\"Announcing .NET 5.0 RC 2\"](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-5-0-rc-2/). _.NET Blog_. 2020-10-13.

It is a _network of networks_ that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries a vast range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked [hypertext](/wiki/Hypertext \"Hypertext\") documents and [applications](/wiki/Web_application \"Web application\") of the [World Wide Web](/wiki/World_Wide_Web \"World Wide Web\") (WWW), [electronic mail](/wiki/Email \"Email\"), [telephony](/wiki/Voice_over_IP \"Voice over IP\"), and [file sharing](/wiki/File_sharing \"File sharing\").\n\nThe origins of the Internet date back to the development of [packet switching](/wiki/Packet_switching \"Packet switching\") and research commissioned by the [United States Department of Defense](/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Defense \"United States Department of Defense\") in the 1960s to enable [time-sharing](/wiki/Time-sharing \"Time-sharing\") of computers.[[1]](#cite_note-:4-1) The primary precursor network, the [ARPANET](/wiki/ARPANET \"ARPANET\"), initially served as a backbone for interconnection of regional academic and military networks in the 1970s. The funding of the [National Science Foundation Network](/wiki/National_Science_Foundation_Network \"National Science Foundation Network\") as a new backbone in the 1980s, as well as private funding for other commercial extensions, led to worldwide participation in the development of new networking technologies, and the merger of many networks.[[2]](#cite_note-2) The linking of commercial networks and enterprises by the early 1990s marked the beginning of the transition to the modern Internet,[[3]](#cite_note-3) and generated a sustained exponential growth as generations of institutional, [personal](/wiki/Personal_computer \"Personal computer\"), and [mobile](/wiki/Mobile_device \"Mobile device\") [computers](/wiki/Computer \"Computer\") were connected to the network. Although the Internet was widely used by [academia](/wiki/Academia \"Academia\") in the 1980s, [commercialization](/wiki/Commercialization_of_the_Internet \"Commercialization of the Internet\") incorporated its services and technologies into virtually every aspect of modern life.\n\nMost traditional communication media, including telephony, radio, television, paper mail and newspapers are reshaped, redefined, or even bypassed by the Internet, giving birth to new services such as [email](/wiki/Email \"Email\"), [Internet telephony](/wiki/Internet_telephony \"Internet telephony\"), [Internet television](/wiki/Internet_television \"Internet television\"), [online music](/wiki/Online_music \"Online music\"), digital newspapers, and [video streaming](/wiki/Video_streaming \"Video streaming\") websites. Newspaper, book, and other print publishing are adapting to [website](/wiki/Web_site \"Web site\") technology, or are reshaped into [blogging](/wiki/Blogging \"Blogging\"), [web feeds](/wiki/Web_feed \"Web feed\") and online [news aggregators](/wiki/News_aggregator \"News aggregator\").

When it came into common use, most publications treated the word as a capitalized [proper noun](/wiki/Proper_noun_and_common_noun \"Proper noun and common noun\"); this has become less common.[[8]](#cite_note-:02-8) This reflects the tendency in English to capitalize new terms and move to lowercase as they become familiar.[[8]](#cite_note-:02-8)[[9]](#cite_note-:12-9) It is sometimes still capitalized to distinguish the global internet from smaller networks, though many publications, including the _[AP Stylebook](/wiki/AP_Stylebook \"AP Stylebook\")_, recommend the lowercase form in every case.[[8]](#cite_note-:02-8)[[9]](#cite_note-:12-9) In 2016, the _[Oxford English Dictionary](/wiki/Oxford_English_Dictionary \"Oxford English Dictionary\")_ found that, based on a study of around 2.5 billion printed and online sources, \"Internet\" was capitalized in 54% of cases.[[10]](#cite_note-10)\n\nThe terms _internet_ and _World Wide Web_ are often used interchangeably; it is common to speak of \"_going on the Internet_\" when using a [web browser](/wiki/Web_browser \"Web browser\") to view [web pages](/wiki/Web_page \"Web page\").

In a sign of future growth, 15 sites were connected to the young ARPANET by the end of 1971.[[19]](#cite_note-19)[[20]](#cite_note-20) These early years were documented in the 1972 film _[Computer Networks: The Heralds of Resource Sharing](/wiki/Computer_Networks:_The_Heralds_of_Resource_Sharing \"Computer Networks: The Heralds of Resource Sharing\")_.[[21]](#cite_note-21)\n\nEarly international collaborations for the ARPANET were rare.

In 1982, the [Internet Protocol Suite](/wiki/Internet_Protocol_Suite \"Internet Protocol Suite\") (TCP/IP) was standardized, which permitted worldwide proliferation of interconnected networks. TCP/IP network access expanded again in 1986 when the [National Science Foundation Network](/wiki/National_Science_Foundation_Network \"National Science Foundation Network\") (NSFNet) provided access to [supercomputer](/wiki/Supercomputer \"Supercomputer\") sites in the United States for researchers, first at speeds of 56 kbit/s and later at 1.5 Mbit/s and 45 Mbit/s.[[29]](#cite_note-29) The NSFNet expanded into academic and research organizations in Europe, Australia, New Zealand and Japan in 1988–89.[[30]](#cite_note-30)[[31]](#cite_note-31)[[32]](#cite_note-32)[[33]](#cite_note-33) Although other network protocols such as [UUCP](/wiki/UUCP \"UUCP\") had global reach well before this time, this marked the beginning of the Internet as an intercontinental network. Commercial [Internet service providers](/wiki/Internet_service_providers \"Internet service providers\") (ISPs) emerged in 1989 in the United States and Australia.[[34]](#cite_note-34) The ARPANET was decommissioned in 1990.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e5/NSFNET-backbone-T3.png/220px-NSFNET-backbone-T3.png)](/wiki/File:NSFNET-backbone-T3.png)\n\n\n\n[](/wiki/File:NSFNET-backbone-T3.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nT3 [NSFNET](/wiki/NSFNET \"NSFNET\") Backbone, c. 1992.\n\n\n\n\n\nSteady advances in [semiconductor](/wiki/Semiconductor \"Semiconductor\") technology and [optical networking](/wiki/Optical_networking \"Optical networking\") created new economic opportunities for commercial involvement in the expansion of the network in its core and for delivering services to the public. In mid-1989, MCI Mail and [Compuserve](/wiki/Compuserve \"Compuserve\") established connections to the Internet, delivering email and public access products to the half million users of the Internet.[[35]](#cite_note-35) Just months later, on 1 January 1990, PSInet launched an alternate Internet backbone for commercial use; one of the networks that added to the core of the commercial Internet of later years. In March 1990, the first high-speed T1 (1.5 Mbit/s) link between the NSFNET and Europe was installed between [Cornell University](/wiki/Cornell_University \"Cornell University\") and [CERN](/wiki/CERN \"CERN\"), allowing much more robust communications than were capable with satellites.[[36]](#cite_note-36) Six months later [Tim Berners-Lee](/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee \"Tim Berners-Lee\") would begin writing [WorldWideWeb](/wiki/WorldWideWeb \"WorldWideWeb\"), the first [web browser](/wiki/Web_browser \"Web browser\") after two years of lobbying CERN management. By Christmas 1990, Berners-Lee had built all the tools necessary for a working Web: the [HyperText Transfer Protocol](/wiki/HyperText_Transfer_Protocol \"HyperText Transfer Protocol\") (HTTP) 0.9,[[37]](#cite_note-37) the [HyperText Markup Language](/wiki/HyperText_Markup_Language \"HyperText Markup Language\") (HTML), the first Web browser (which was also a [HTML editor](/wiki/HTML_editor \"HTML editor\") and could access [Usenet](/wiki/Usenet \"Usenet\") newsgroups and [FTP](/wiki/FTP \"FTP\") files), the first HTTP [server software](/wiki/Server_application \"Server application\") (later known as [CERN httpd](/wiki/CERN_httpd \"CERN httpd\")), the first [web server](/wiki/Web_server \"Web server\"),[[38]](#cite_note-38) and the first Web pages that described the project itself. In 1991 the [Commercial Internet eXchange](/wiki/Commercial_Internet_eXchange \"Commercial Internet eXchange\") was founded, allowing PSInet to communicate with the other commercial networks CERFnet and Alternet. [Stanford Federal Credit Union](/wiki/Stanford_Federal_Credit_Union \"Stanford Federal Credit Union\") was the first [financial institution](/wiki/Financial_institution \"Financial institution\") to offer online Internet banking services to all of its members in October 1994.[[39]](#cite_note-39) In 1996, [OP Financial Group](/wiki/OP_Financial_Group \"OP Financial Group\"), also a [cooperative bank](/wiki/Cooperative_bank \"Cooperative bank\"), became the second online bank in the world and the first in Europe.[[40]](#cite_note-40) By 1995, the Internet was fully commercialized in the U.S. when the NSFNet was decommissioned, removing the last restrictions on use of the Internet to carry commercial traffic.[[41]](#cite_note-ConneXions-April1996-41)\n\n**[Worldwide Internet users](/wiki/List_of_countries_by_number_of_Internet_users \"List of countries by number of Internet users\")**\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n**2005**\n\n**2010**\n\n**2017**\n\n**2019**a\n\n\n\n\n\n**World population**[[42]](#cite_note-WWIU_USCensus-WorldPop1950to2050-2014-42)\n\n6.5 billion\n\n6.9 billion\n\n7.4 billion\n\n7.75 billion\n\n\n\n\n\n**Users worldwide**\n\n16%\n\n30%\n\n48%\n\n53.6%\n\n\n\n\n\n**Users in the developing world**\n\n8%\n\n21%\n\n41.3%\n\n47%\n\n\n\n\n\n**Users in the developed world**\n\n51%\n\n67%\n\n81%\n\n86.6%\n\n\n\n\n\na Estimate.  \nSource: [International Telecommunications Union](/wiki/International_Telecommunications_Union \"International Telecommunications Union\").[[43]](#cite_note-WWIU_ITCFactsAndFigures-2014-43)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs technology advanced and commercial opportunities fueled reciprocal growth, the volume of [Internet traffic](/wiki/Internet_traffic \"Internet traffic\") started experiencing similar characteristics as that of the scaling of [MOS transistors](/wiki/MOS_transistor \"MOS transistor\"), exemplified by [Moore's law](/wiki/Moore%27s_law \"Moore's law\"), doubling every 18 months. This growth, formalized as [Edholm's law](/wiki/Edholm%27s_law \"Edholm's law\"), was catalyzed by advances in [MOS technology](/wiki/MOS_technology \"MOS technology\"), [laser](/wiki/Laser \"Laser\") lightwave systems, and [noise](/wiki/Noise_(signal_processing) \"Noise (signal processing)\") performance.[[44]](#cite_note-Jindal-44)\n\nSince 1995, the Internet has tremendously impacted culture and commerce, including the rise of near instant communication by email, [instant messaging](/wiki/Instant_messaging \"Instant messaging\"), telephony ([Voice over Internet Protocol](/wiki/Voice_over_Internet_Protocol \"Voice over Internet Protocol\") or VoIP), [two-way interactive video calls](/wiki/Video_chat \"Video chat\"), and the [World Wide Web](/wiki/World_Wide_Web \"World Wide Web\")[[45]](#cite_note-45) with its [discussion forums](/wiki/Discussion_forums \"Discussion forums\"), blogs, [social networking services](/wiki/Social_networking_service \"Social networking service\"), and [online shopping](/wiki/Online_shopping \"Online shopping\") sites. Increasing amounts of data are transmitted at higher and higher speeds over fiber optic networks operating at 1-Gbit/s, 10-Gbit/s, or more. The Internet continues to grow, driven by ever greater amounts of online information and knowledge, commerce, entertainment and [social networking services](/wiki/Social_networking_service \"Social networking service\").[[46]](#cite_note-46) During the late 1990s, it was estimated that traffic on the public Internet grew by 100 percent per year, while the mean annual growth in the number of Internet users was thought to be between 20% and 50%.[[47]](#cite_note-47) This growth is often attributed to the lack of central administration, which allows organic growth of the network, as well as the non-proprietary nature of the Internet protocols, which encourages vendor interoperability and prevents any one company from exerting too much control over the network.[[48]](#cite_note-48) As of 31 March 2011[[update]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Internet&action=edit), the estimated total number of [Internet users](/wiki/Internet_users \"Internet users\") was 2.095 billion (30.2% of world population).[[49]](#cite_note-stats1-49) It is estimated that in 1993 the Internet carried only 1% of the information flowing through two-way [telecommunication](/wiki/Telecommunication \"Telecommunication\").

It operates without a central governing body. The technical underpinning and standardization of the core protocols ([IPv4](/wiki/IPv4 \"IPv4\") and [IPv6](/wiki/IPv6 \"IPv6\")) is an activity of the [Internet Engineering Task Force](/wiki/Internet_Engineering_Task_Force \"Internet Engineering Task Force\") (IETF), a non-profit organization of loosely affiliated international participants that anyone may associate with by contributing technical expertise. To maintain interoperability, the principal [name spaces](/wiki/Name_space \"Name space\") of the Internet are administered by the [Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers](/wiki/Internet_Corporation_for_Assigned_Names_and_Numbers \"Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers\") (ICANN). ICANN is governed by an international board of directors drawn from across the Internet technical, business, academic, and other non-commercial communities. ICANN coordinates the assignment of unique identifiers for use on the Internet, including [domain names](/wiki/Domain_name \"Domain name\"), Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, application port numbers in the transport protocols, and many other parameters. Globally unified name spaces are essential for maintaining the global reach of the Internet. This role of ICANN distinguishes it as perhaps the only central coordinating body for the global Internet.[[51]](#cite_note-51)\n\n[Regional Internet registries](/wiki/Regional_Internet_registry \"Regional Internet registry\") (RIRs) were established for five regions of the world.

On 16 November 2005, the United Nations-sponsored [World Summit on the Information Society](/wiki/World_Summit_on_the_Information_Society \"World Summit on the Information Society\") in [Tunis](/wiki/Tunis \"Tunis\") established the [Internet Governance Forum](/wiki/Internet_Governance_Forum \"Internet Governance Forum\") (IGF) to discuss Internet-related issues.\n\n## Infrastructure\n\nSee also: [List of countries by number of Internet users](/wiki/List_of_countries_by_number_of_Internet_users \"List of countries by number of Internet users\") and [List of countries by Internet connection speeds](/wiki/List_of_countries_by_Internet_connection_speeds \"List of countries by Internet connection speeds\")\n\n\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/World_map_of_submarine_cables.png/220px-World_map_of_submarine_cables.png)](/wiki/File:World_map_of_submarine_cables.png)\n\n\n\n[](/wiki/File:World_map_of_submarine_cables.png \"Enlarge\")\n\n2007 map showing submarine fiberoptic telecommunication cables around the world.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe communications infrastructure of the Internet consists of its hardware components and a system of software layers that control various aspects of the architecture. As with any computer network, the Internet physically consists of [routers](/wiki/Router_(computing) \"Router (computing)\"), media (such as cabling and radio links), repeaters, modems etc. However, as an example of [internetworking](/wiki/Internetworking \"Internetworking\"), many of the network nodes are not necessarily internet equipment per se, the internet packets are carried by other full-fledged networking protocols with the Internet acting as a homogeneous networking standard, running across [heterogeneous](/wiki/Heterogeneous \"Heterogeneous\") hardware, with the packets guided to their destinations by IP routers.\n\n### Routing and service tiers\n\n\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/Internet_Connectivity_Distribution_%26_Core.svg/220px-Internet_Connectivity_Distribution_%26_Core.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Internet_Connectivity_Distribution_%26_Core.svg)\n\n\n\n[](/wiki/File:Internet_Connectivity_Distribution_%26_Core.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\nPacket routing across the Internet involves several tiers of Internet service providers.\n\n\n\n\n\n[Internet service providers](/wiki/Internet_service_provider \"Internet service provider\") (ISPs) establish the worldwide connectivity between individual networks at various levels of scope. End-users who only access the Internet when needed to perform a function or obtain information, represent the bottom of the routing hierarchy. At the top of the routing hierarchy are the [tier 1 networks](/wiki/Tier_1_network \"Tier 1 network\"), large telecommunication companies that exchange traffic directly with each other via very high speed [fibre optic cables](/wiki/Fibre_optic_cable \"Fibre optic cable\") and governed by [peering](/wiki/Peering \"Peering\") agreements. [Tier 2](/wiki/Tier_2_network \"Tier 2 network\") and lower level networks buy [Internet transit](/wiki/Internet_transit \"Internet transit\") from other providers to reach at least some parties on the global Internet, though they may also engage in peering. An ISP may use a single upstream provider for connectivity, or implement [multihoming](/wiki/Multihoming \"Multihoming\") to achieve redundancy and load balancing. [Internet exchange points](/wiki/Internet_exchange_point \"Internet exchange point\") are major traffic exchanges with physical connections to multiple ISPs. Large organizations, such as academic institutions, large enterprises, and governments, may perform the same function as ISPs, engaging in peering and purchasing transit on behalf of their internal networks. Research networks tend to interconnect with large subnetworks such as [GEANT](/wiki/GEANT \"GEANT\"), [GLORIAD](/wiki/GLORIAD \"GLORIAD\"), [Internet2](/wiki/Internet2 \"Internet2\"), and the UK's [national research and education network](/wiki/National_research_and_education_network \"National research and education network\"), [JANET](/wiki/JANET \"JANET\"). Both the Internet IP routing structure and hypertext links of the World Wide Web are examples of [scale-free networks](/wiki/Scale-free_network \"Scale-free network\").[[57]](#cite_note-57)[_[disputed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Disputed_statement \"Wikipedia:Disputed statement\") (for: unclear whether citation supports claim empirically)  – [discuss](/wiki/Talk:Internet#Empirical_evidence_that_hypertext_link_network_is_scale-free \"Talk:Internet\")_] Computers and [routers](/wiki/Router_(computing) \"Router (computing)\") use [routing tables](/wiki/Routing_table \"Routing table\") in their operating system to [direct IP packets](/wiki/IP_forwarding \"IP forwarding\") to the next-hop router or destination. Routing tables are maintained by manual configuration or automatically by [routing protocols](/wiki/Routing_protocol \"Routing protocol\"). End-nodes typically use a [default route](/wiki/Default_route \"Default route\") that points toward an ISP providing transit, while ISP routers use the [Border Gateway Protocol](/wiki/Border_Gateway_Protocol \"Border Gateway Protocol\") to establish the most efficient routing across the complex connections of the global Internet.\n\n### Access\n\nCommon methods of [Internet access](/wiki/Internet_access \"Internet access\") by users include dial-up with a computer [modem](/wiki/Modem \"Modem\") via telephone circuits, [broadband](/wiki/Broadband_Internet_access \"Broadband Internet access\") over [coaxial cable](/wiki/Coaxial_cable \"Coaxial cable\"), [fiber optics](/wiki/Optical_fiber \"Optical fiber\") or copper wires, [Wi-Fi](/wiki/Wi-Fi \"Wi-Fi\"), [satellite](/wiki/Satellite_Internet \"Satellite Internet\"), and [cellular telephone](/wiki/Mobile_telephony \"Mobile telephony\") technology (e.g. [3G](/wiki/3G \"3G\"), [4G](/wiki/4G \"4G\")). The Internet may often be accessed from computers in libraries and [Internet cafes](/wiki/Internet_cafe \"Internet cafe\"). [Internet access points](/wiki/Internet_kiosk \"Internet kiosk\") exist in many public places such as airport halls and coffee shops. Various terms are used, such as _public Internet kiosk_, _public access terminal_, and _Web [payphone](/wiki/Payphone \"Payphone\")_. Many hotels also have public terminals that are usually fee-based. These terminals are widely accessed for various usages, such as ticket booking, bank deposit, or online payment. Wi-Fi provides wireless access to the Internet via local computer networks. [Hotspots](/wiki/Hotspot_(Wi-Fi) \"Hotspot (Wi-Fi)\") providing such access include [Wi-Fi cafes](/wiki/Wi-Fi#Internet_access \"Wi-Fi\"), where users need to bring their own wireless devices such as a laptop or [PDA](/wiki/Personal_Digital_Assistant \"Personal Digital Assistant\"). These services may be free to all, free to customers only, or fee-based.\n\n[Grassroots](/wiki/Grassroots \"Grassroots\") efforts have led to [wireless community networks](/wiki/Wireless_community_network \"Wireless community network\"). Commercial Wi-Fi services that cover large areas are available in many cities, such as [New York](/wiki/New_York_City \"New York City\"), [London](/wiki/London \"London\"), [Vienna](/wiki/Vienna \"Vienna\"), [Toronto](/wiki/Toronto \"Toronto\"), [San Francisco](/wiki/San_Francisco \"San Francisco\"), [Philadelphia](/wiki/Philadelphia \"Philadelphia\"), [Chicago](/wiki/Chicago \"Chicago\") and [Pittsburgh](/wiki/Pittsburgh \"Pittsburgh\"), where the Internet can then be accessed from places such as a park bench.[[58]](#cite_note-58) Experiments have also been conducted with proprietary mobile wireless networks like [Ricochet](/wiki/Ricochet_(Internet_service) \"Ricochet (Internet service)\"), various high-speed data services over cellular networks, and fixed wireless services. Modern [smartphones](/wiki/Smartphone \"Smartphone\") can also access the Internet through the cellular carrier network. For Web browsing, these devices provide applications such as [Google Chrome](/wiki/Google_Chrome \"Google Chrome\"), [Safari](/wiki/Safari_(web_browser) \"Safari (web browser)\"), and [Firefox](/wiki/Firefox \"Firefox\") and a wide variety of other Internet software may be installed from app-stores. Internet usage by mobile and tablet devices exceeded desktop worldwide for the first time in October 2016.[[59]](#cite_note-59)\n\n#### Mobile communication\n\n\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/Number_of_mobile_cellular_subscriptions_2012-2016.svg/159px-Number_of_mobile_cellular_subscriptions_2012-2016.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Number_of_mobile_cellular_subscriptions_2012-2016.svg)\n\n\n\n[](/wiki/File:Number_of_mobile_cellular_subscriptions_2012-2016.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\nNumber of mobile cellular subscriptions 2012–2016, [_World Trends in Freedom of Expression and Media Development Global Report 2017/2018_](http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0026/002610/261065e.pdf)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe [International Telecommunication Union](/wiki/International_Telecommunication_Union \"International Telecommunication Union\") (ITU) estimated that, by the end of 2017, 48% of individual users regularly connect to the Internet, up from 34% in 2012.[[60]](#cite_note-60) [Mobile Internet](/wiki/Mobile_Web \"Mobile Web\") connectivity has played an important role in expanding access in recent years especially in [Asia and the Pacific](/wiki/Asia-Pacific \"Asia-Pacific\") and in [Africa](/wiki/Africa \"Africa\").[[61]](#cite_note-:0-61) The number of unique mobile cellular subscriptions increased from 3.89 billion in 2012 to 4.83 billion in 2016, two-thirds of the world's population, with more than half of subscriptions located in Asia and the Pacific. The number of subscriptions is predicted to rise to 5.69 billion users in 2020.[[62]](#cite_note-:1-62) As of 2016[[update]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Internet&action=edit), almost 60% of the world's population had access to a [4G](/wiki/4G \"4G\") broadband cellular network, up from almost 50% in 2015 and 11% in 2012.[_[disputed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Disputed_statement \"Wikipedia:Disputed statement\") – [discuss](/wiki/Talk:Internet#Statistics_on_4G_access_not_found \"Talk:Internet\")_][[62]](#cite_note-:1-62) The limits that users face on accessing information via mobile applications coincide with a broader process of [fragmentation of the Internet](/wiki/Fragmentation_(computing) \"Fragmentation (computing)\"). Fragmentation restricts access to media content and tends to affect poorest users the most.[[61]](#cite_note-:0-61)\n\n[Zero-rating](/wiki/Zero-rating \"Zero-rating\"), the practice of [Internet service providers](/wiki/Internet_service_provider \"Internet service provider\") allowing users free connectivity to access specific content or applications without cost, has offered opportunities to surmount economic hurdles, but has also been accused by its critics as creating a two-tiered Internet. To address the issues with zero-rating, an alternative model has emerged in the concept of 'equal rating' and is being tested in experiments by [Mozilla](/wiki/Mozilla \"Mozilla\") and [Orange](/wiki/Orange_S.A. \"Orange S.A.\") in [Africa](/wiki/Africa \"Africa\"). Equal rating prevents prioritization of one type of content and zero-rates all content up to a specified data cap. A study published by [Chatham House](/wiki/Chatham_House \"Chatham House\"), 15 out of 19 countries researched in [Latin America](/wiki/Latin_America \"Latin America\") had some kind of hybrid or zero-rated product offered. Some countries in the region had a handful of plans to choose from (across all mobile network operators) while others, such as [Colombia](/wiki/Colombia \"Colombia\"), offered as many as 30 pre-paid and 34 post-paid plans.[[63]](#cite_note-63)\n\nA study of eight countries in the [Global South](/wiki/Global_South \"Global South\") found that zero-rated data plans exist in every country, although there is a great range in the frequency with which they are offered and actually used in each.[[64]](#cite_note-64) The study looked at the top three to five carriers by market share in Bangladesh, Colombia, Ghana, India, Kenya, Nigeria, Peru and Philippines. Across the 181 plans examined, 13 per cent were offering zero-rated services. Another study, covering [Ghana](/wiki/Ghana \"Ghana\"), [Kenya](/wiki/Kenya \"Kenya\"), [Nigeria](/wiki/Nigeria \"Nigeria\") and [South Africa](/wiki/South_Africa \"South Africa\"), found [Facebook](/wiki/Facebook \"Facebook\")'s Free Basics and [Wikipedia Zero](/wiki/Wikipedia_Zero \"Wikipedia Zero\") to be the most commonly zero-rated content.[[65]](#cite_note-65)\n\n## Internet

[e](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:IPstack&action=edit)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Internet standards describe a framework known as the [Internet protocol suite](/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite \"Internet protocol suite\") (also called [TCP/IP](/wiki/TCP/IP \"TCP/IP\"), based on the first two components.) This is a model architecture that divides methods into a [layered system of protocols](/wiki/Communication_protocol#Layering \"Communication protocol\"), originally documented in [RFC](/wiki/RFC_(identifier) \"RFC (identifier)\") [1122](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1122) and [RFC](/wiki/RFC_(identifier) \"RFC (identifier)\") [1123](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1123).\n\n### Layers\n\nThe software layers correspond to the environment or scope in which their services operate. At the top is the [application layer](/wiki/Application_layer \"Application layer\"), space for the application-specific networking methods used in software applications. For example, a web browser program uses the [client-server](/wiki/Client-server \"Client-server\") application model and a specific protocol of interaction between servers and clients, while many file-sharing systems use a [peer-to-peer](/wiki/Peer-to-peer \"Peer-to-peer\") paradigm.\n\nBelow this top layer, the [transport layer](/wiki/Transport_layer \"Transport layer\") connects applications on different hosts with a logical channel through the network with appropriate data exchange methods. It provides several services including ordered, reliable delivery (TCP), and an unreliable datagram service (UDP).\n\nUnderlying these layers are the networking technologies that interconnect networks at their borders and exchange traffic across them. The [Internet layer](/wiki/Internet_layer \"Internet layer\") implements the [Internet Protocol](/wiki/Internet_Protocol \"Internet Protocol\") which enables computers to identify and locate each other by [Internet Protocol (IP) addresses](/wiki/IP_address \"IP address\"), and route their traffic via intermediate (transit) networks.[[66]](#cite_note-66) The internet protocol layer code is independent of the type of network that it is physically running over.\n\nAt the bottom of the architecture is the [link layer](/wiki/Link_layer \"Link layer\"), which provides logical connectivity between hosts. The link layer code is usually the only software part customized to the type of physical networking link protocol. Many link layers have been implemented and each operates over a type of network link, such as within a [local area network](/wiki/Local_area_network \"Local area network\") (LAN) or [wide area network](/wiki/Wide_area_network \"Wide area network\") (e.g. [Wi-Fi](/wiki/Wi-Fi \"Wi-Fi\") or [Ethernet](/wiki/Ethernet \"Ethernet\") or a [dial-up connection](/wiki/Dial-up_Internet_access \"Dial-up Internet access\"), [ATM](/wiki/Asynchronous_transfer_mode \"Asynchronous transfer mode\") etc.).\n\n\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/UDP_encapsulation.svg/220px-UDP_encapsulation.svg.png)](/wiki/File:UDP_encapsulation.svg)\n\n\n\n[](/wiki/File:UDP_encapsulation.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\nAs user data is processed through the protocol stack, each abstraction layer adds encapsulation information at the sending host. Data is transmitted _over the wire_ at the link level between hosts and routers. Encapsulation is removed by the receiving host. Intermediate relays update link encapsulation at each hop, and inspect the IP layer for routing purposes.\n\n\n\n\n\n### Internet protocol\n\n\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/IP_stack_connections.svg/220px-IP_stack_connections.svg.png)](/wiki/File:IP_stack_connections.svg)\n\n\n\n[](/wiki/File:IP_stack_connections.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\nConceptual data flow in a simple network topology of two hosts (_A_ and _B_) connected by a link between their respective routers. The application on each host executes read and write operations as if the processes were directly connected to each other by some kind of data pipe. After establishment of this pipe, most details of the communication are hidden from each process, as the underlying principles of communication are implemented in the lower protocol layers. In analogy, at the transport layer the communication appears as host-to-host, without knowledge of the application data structures and the connecting routers, while at the internetworking layer, individual network boundaries are traversed at each router.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe most prominent component of the Internet model is the Internet Protocol (IP). IP enables internetworking and, in essence, establishes the Internet itself. Two versions of the Internet Protocol exist, IPV4 and IPV6.\n\n#### IP Addresses\n\n\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/Example_of_an_iterative_DNS_resolver.svg/220px-Example_of_an_iterative_DNS_resolver.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Example_of_an_iterative_DNS_resolver.svg)\n\n\n\n[](/wiki/File:Example_of_an_iterative_DNS_resolver.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\nA DNS resolver consults three name servers to resolve the domain name user-visible \"www.wikipedia.org\" to determine the IPV4 Address 207.142.131.234\n\n\n\n\n\nFor locating individual computers on the network, the Internet provides [IP addresses](/wiki/IP_address \"IP address\"). IP addresses are used by the Internet infrastructure to direct internet packets to their destinations. They consist of fixed-length numbers, which are found within the packet. IP addresses are generally assigned to equipment either automatically via [DHCP](/wiki/DHCP \"DHCP\"), or are configured.\n\nHowever the network also supports other addressing systems. Users generally enter [domain names](/wiki/Fully_qualified_domain_name \"Fully qualified domain name\") (e.g. \"en.wikipedia.org\") instead of IP addresses because they are easier to remember, they are converted by the [Domain Name System](/wiki/Domain_Name_System \"Domain Name System\") (DNS) into IP addresses which are more efficient for routing purposes.\n\n#### IPv4\n\n[Internet Protocol version 4](/wiki/IPv4 \"IPv4\") (IPv4) defines an IP address as a [32-bit](/wiki/32-bit \"32-bit\") number.[[67]](#cite_note-rfc791-67) [Internet Protocol Version 4](/wiki/IPv4 \"IPv4\") (IPv4) is the initial version used on the first generation of the Internet and is still in dominant use. It was designed to address up to ≈4.3 billion (109) hosts. However, the explosive growth of the Internet has led to [IPv4 address exhaustion](/wiki/IPv4_address_exhaustion \"IPv4 address exhaustion\"), which entered its final stage in 2011,[[68]](#cite_note-68) when the global IPv4 address allocation pool was exhausted.\n\n#### IPv6\n\nBecause of the growth of the Internet and the [depletion of available IPv4 addresses](/wiki/IPv4_address_exhaustion \"IPv4 address exhaustion\"), a new version of IP [IPv6](/wiki/IPv6 \"IPv6\"), was developed in the mid-1990s, which provides vastly larger addressing capabilities and more efficient routing of Internet traffic. IPv6 uses 128 bits for the IP address and was standardized in 1998.[[69]](#cite_note-rfc1883-69)[[70]](#cite_note-rfc2460-70)[[71]](#cite_note-rfc8200-71) [IPv6 deployment](/wiki/IPv6_deployment \"IPv6 deployment\") has been ongoing since the mid-2000s. [IPv6](/wiki/IPv6 \"IPv6\") is currently in growing [deployment](/wiki/IPv6_deployment \"IPv6 deployment\") around the world, since Internet address registries ([RIRs](/wiki/Regional_Internet_registry \"Regional Internet registry\")) began to urge all resource managers to plan rapid adoption and conversion.[[72]](#cite_note-72)\n\nIPv6 is not directly interoperable by design with IPv4\\. In essence, it establishes a parallel version of the Internet not directly accessible with IPv4 software. Thus, translation facilities must exist for internetworking or nodes must have duplicate networking software for both networks. Essentially all modern computer operating systems support both versions of the Internet Protocol. Network infrastructure, however, has been lagging in this development. Aside from the complex array of physical connections that make up its infrastructure, the Internet is facilitated by bi- or multi-lateral commercial contracts, e.g., [peering agreements](/wiki/Peering_agreement \"Peering agreement\"), and by technical specifications or protocols that describe the exchange of data over the network. Indeed, the Internet is defined by its interconnections and routing policies.\n\n#### Subnetwork\n\n\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/14/Subnetting_Concept-en.svg/300px-Subnetting_Concept-en.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Subnetting_Concept-en.svg)\n\n\n\n[](/wiki/File:Subnetting_Concept-en.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\nCreating a subnet by dividing the host identifier\n\n\n\n\n\nA _[subnetwork](/wiki/Subnetwork \"Subnetwork\")_ or _subnet_ is a logical subdivision of an [IP network](/wiki/IP_network \"IP network\").[[73]](#cite_note-rfc950-73):1,16 The practice of dividing a network into two or more networks is called _subnetting_.\n\nComputers that belong to a subnet are addressed with an identical [most-significant bit](/wiki/Most-significant_bit \"Most-significant bit\")-group in their [IP addresses](/wiki/IP_address \"IP address\"). This results in the logical division of an IP address into two fields, the _network number_ or _routing prefix_ and the _rest field_ or _host identifier_. The _rest field_ is an identifier for a specific [host](/wiki/Host_(network) \"Host (network)\") or network interface.\n\nThe _routing prefix_ may be expressed in [Classless Inter-Domain Routing](/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing \"Classless Inter-Domain Routing\") (CIDR) notation written as the first address of a network, followed by a slash character (_/_), and ending with the bit-length of the prefix. For example, _198.51.100.0/24_ is the prefix of the [Internet Protocol version 4](/wiki/Internet_Protocol_version_4 \"Internet Protocol version 4\") network starting at the given address, having 24 bits allocated for the network prefix, and the remaining 8 bits reserved for host addressing. Addresses in the range _198.51.100.0_ to _198.51.100.255_ belong to this network. The [IPv6](/wiki/IPv6 \"IPv6\") address specification _2001:db8::/32_ is a large address block with 296 addresses, having a 32-bit routing prefix.\n\nFor IPv4, a network may also be characterized by its _subnet mask_ or _netmask_, which is the [bitmask](/wiki/Bitmask \"Bitmask\") that when applied by a [bitwise AND](/wiki/Bitwise_AND \"Bitwise AND\") operation to any IP address in the network, yields the routing prefix. Subnet masks are also expressed in [dot-decimal notation](/wiki/Dot-decimal_notation \"Dot-decimal notation\") like an address. For example, _255.255.255.0_ is the subnet mask for the prefix _198.51.100.0/24_.\n\nTraffic is exchanged between subnetworks through [routers](/wiki/Router_(computing) \"Router (computing)\") when the routing prefixes of the source address and the destination address differ. A router serves as a logical or physical boundary between the subnets.\n\nThe benefits of subnetting an existing network vary with each deployment scenario. In the address allocation architecture of the Internet using CIDR and in large organizations, it is necessary to allocate address space efficiently. Subnetting may also enhance routing efficiency, or have advantages in network management when subnetworks are administratively controlled by different entities in a larger organization. Subnets may be arranged logically in a hierarchical architecture, partitioning an organization's network address space into a tree-like routing structure.\n\n### IETF\n\nWhile the hardware components in the Internet infrastructure can often be used to support other software systems, it is the design and the standardization process of the software that characterizes the Internet and provides the foundation for its scalability and success. The responsibility for the architectural design of the Internet software systems has been assumed by the [Internet Engineering Task Force](/wiki/Internet_Engineering_Task_Force \"Internet Engineering Task Force\") (IETF).[[74]](#cite_note-74) The IETF conducts standard-setting work groups, open to any individual, about the various aspects of Internet architecture. Resulting contributions and standards are published as _[Request for Comments](/wiki/Request_for_Comments \"Request for Comments\")_ (RFC) documents on the IETF web site. The principal methods of networking that enable the Internet are contained in specially designated RFCs that constitute the [Internet Standards](/wiki/Internet_Standard \"Internet Standard\"). Other less rigorous documents are simply informative, experimental, or historical, or document the best current practices (BCP) when implementing Internet technologies.\n\n## Applications and services\n\nThe Internet carries many [applications and services](/wiki/Network_service \"Network service\"), most prominently the [World Wide Web](/wiki/World_Wide_Web \"World Wide Web\"), including [social media](/wiki/Social_media \"Social media\"), [electronic mail](/wiki/Electronic_mail \"Electronic mail\"), [mobile applications](/wiki/Mobile_app \"Mobile app\"), [multiplayer online games](/wiki/Multiplayer_online_game \"Multiplayer online game\"), [Internet telephony](/wiki/Internet_telephony \"Internet telephony\"), [file sharing](/wiki/File_sharing \"File sharing\"), and [streaming media](/wiki/Streaming_media \"Streaming media\") services.\n\nMost [servers](/wiki/Server_(computing) \"Server (computing)\") that provide these services are today hosted in [data centers](/wiki/Data_center \"Data center\"), and content is often accessed through high-performance [content delivery networks](/wiki/Content_delivery_network \"Content delivery network\").\n\n### World Wide Web\n\nMain article: [World Wide Web](/wiki/World_Wide_Web \"World Wide Web\")\n\n\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d1/First_Web_Server.jpg/220px-First_Web_Server.jpg)](/wiki/File:First_Web_Server.jpg)\n\n\n\n[](/wiki/File:First_Web_Server.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThis [NeXT Computer](/wiki/NeXT_Computer \"NeXT Computer\") was used by [Tim Berners-Lee](/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee \"Tim Berners-Lee\") at [CERN](/wiki/CERN \"CERN\") and became the world's first [Web server](/wiki/Web_server \"Web server\").\n\n\n\n\n\nThe World Wide Web is a global collection of [documents](/wiki/Documents \"Documents\"), [images](/wiki/Computer_graphics \"Computer graphics\"), [multimedia](/wiki/Multimedia \"Multimedia\"), applications, and other resources, logically interrelated by [hyperlinks](/wiki/Hyperlink \"Hyperlink\") and referenced with [Uniform Resource Identifiers](/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier \"Uniform Resource Identifier\") (URIs), which provide a global system of named references. URIs symbolically identify services, [web servers](/wiki/Web_servers \"Web servers\"), databases, and the documents and resources that they can provide. [Hypertext Transfer Protocol](/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol \"Hypertext Transfer Protocol\") (HTTP) is the main access protocol of the World Wide Web. [Web services](/wiki/Web_service \"Web service\") also use HTTP for communication between software systems for information transfer, sharing and exchanging business data and logistic and is one of many languages or protocols that can be used for communication on the Internet.[[75]](#cite_note-75)\n\nWorld Wide Web browser software, such as [Microsoft](/wiki/Microsoft \"Microsoft\")'s [Internet Explorer](/wiki/Internet_Explorer \"Internet Explorer\")/[Edge](/wiki/Microsoft_Edge \"Microsoft Edge\"), [Mozilla Firefox](/wiki/Mozilla_Firefox \"Mozilla Firefox\"), [Opera](/wiki/Opera_(web_browser) \"Opera (web browser)\"), [Apple](/wiki/Apple_Inc. \"Apple Inc.\")'s [Safari](/wiki/Safari_(web_browser) \"Safari (web browser)\"), and [Google Chrome](/wiki/Google_Chrome \"Google Chrome\"), lets users navigate from one web page to another via the hyperlinks embedded in the documents. These documents may also contain any combination of [computer data](/wiki/Computer_data \"Computer data\"), including graphics, sounds, [text](/wiki/Plain_text \"Plain text\"), [video](/wiki/Web_video \"Web video\"), [multimedia](/wiki/Multimedia \"Multimedia\") and interactive content that runs while the user is interacting with the page. [Client-side software](/wiki/Client-side_scripting \"Client-side scripting\") can include animations, [games](/wiki/Web_game \"Web game\"), [office applications](/wiki/Office_applications \"Office applications\") and scientific demonstrations. Through [keyword](/wiki/Keyword_(Internet_search) \"Keyword (Internet search)\")-driven [Internet research](/wiki/Internet_research \"Internet research\") using [search engines](/wiki/Web_search_engine \"Web search engine\") like [Yahoo!](/wiki/Yahoo!_Search \"Yahoo! Search\"), [Bing](/wiki/Bing_(search_engine) \"Bing (search engine)\") and [Google](/wiki/Google_Search \"Google Search\"), users worldwide have easy, instant access to a vast and diverse amount of online information. Compared to printed media, books, encyclopedias and traditional libraries, the World Wide Web has enabled the decentralization of information on a large scale.\n\nThe Web has enabled individuals and organizations to [publish](/wiki/Publish \"Publish\") ideas and information to a potentially large [audience](/wiki/Audience \"Audience\") online at greatly reduced expense and time delay. Publishing a web page, a blog, or building a website involves little initial [cost](/wiki/Cost \"Cost\") and many cost-free services are available. However, publishing and maintaining large, professional web sites with attractive, diverse and up-to-date information is still a difficult and expensive proposition. Many individuals and some companies and groups use _web logs_ or blogs, which are largely used as easily updatable online diaries. Some commercial organizations encourage [staff](/wiki/Employees \"Employees\") to communicate advice in their areas of specialization in the hope that visitors will be impressed by the expert knowledge and free information, and be attracted to the corporation as a result.\n\n[Advertising](/wiki/Online_advertising \"Online advertising\") on popular web pages can be lucrative, and [e-commerce](/wiki/E-commerce \"E-commerce\"), which is the sale of products and services directly via the Web, continues to grow. Online advertising is a form of [marketing](/wiki/Marketing \"Marketing\") and advertising which uses the Internet to deliver [promotional](/wiki/Promotion_(marketing) \"Promotion (marketing)\") marketing messages to consumers. It includes email marketing, [search engine marketing](/wiki/Search_engine_marketing \"Search engine marketing\") (SEM), social media marketing, many types of [display advertising](/wiki/Display_advertising \"Display advertising\") (including [web banner](/wiki/Web_banner \"Web banner\") advertising), and [mobile advertising](/wiki/Mobile_advertising \"Mobile advertising\"). In 2011, Internet advertising revenues in the United States surpassed those of [cable television](/wiki/Cable_television \"Cable television\") and nearly exceeded those of [broadcast television](/wiki/Broadcast_television \"Broadcast television\").[[76]](#cite_note-IAB2012-76):19 Many common online advertising practices are controversial and increasingly subject to regulation.\n\nWhen the Web developed in the 1990s, a typical web page was stored in completed form on a web server, formatted in [HTML](/wiki/HTML \"HTML\"), complete for transmission to a web browser in response to a request. Over time, the process of creating and serving web pages has become dynamic, creating a flexible design, layout, and content. Websites are often created using [content management](/wiki/Content_management \"Content management\") software with, initially, very little content. Contributors to these systems, who may be paid staff, members of an organization or the public, fill underlying databases with content using editing pages designed for that purpose while casual visitors view and read this content in HTML form. There may or may not be editorial, approval and security systems built into the process of taking newly entered content and making it available to the target visitors.\n\n### Communication\n\n[Email](/wiki/Email \"Email\") is an important communications service available via the Internet. The concept of sending electronic text messages between parties, analogous to mailing letters or memos, predates the creation of the Internet.[[77]](#cite_note-77)[[78]](#cite_note-78) Pictures, documents, and other files are sent as [email attachments](/wiki/Email_attachment \"Email attachment\"). Email messages can be [cc-ed](/wiki/Carbon_copy \"Carbon copy\") to multiple [email addresses](/wiki/Email_address \"Email address\").\n\n[Internet telephony](/wiki/Internet_telephony \"Internet telephony\") is a common communications service realized with the Internet. The name of the principle internetworking protocol, the [Internet Protocol](/wiki/Internet_Protocol \"Internet Protocol\"), lends its name to [voice over Internet Protocol](/wiki/Voice_over_Internet_Protocol \"Voice over Internet Protocol\") (VoIP). The idea began in the early 1990s with [walkie-talkie](/wiki/Walkie-talkie \"Walkie-talkie\")-like voice applications for personal computers. VoIP systems now dominate many markets, and are as easy to use and as convenient as a traditional telephone. The benefit has been in substantial cost savings over traditional telephone calls, especially over long distances. [Cable](/wiki/Cable_modem \"Cable modem\"), [ADSL](/wiki/ADSL \"ADSL\"), and [mobile data](/wiki/Mobile_data \"Mobile data\") networks provide [Internet access](/wiki/Internet_access \"Internet access\") in customer premises[[79]](#cite_note-EBSCOhost-79) and inexpensive VoIP network adapters provide the connection for traditional analog telephone sets. The voice quality of VoIP often exceeds that of traditional calls. Remaining problems for VoIP include the situation that emergency services may not be universally available, and that devices rely on a local power supply, while older traditional phones are powered from the local loop, and typically operate during a power failure.\n\n### Data transfer\n\n[File sharing](/wiki/File_sharing \"File sharing\") is an example of transferring large amounts of data across the Internet. A [computer file](/wiki/Computer_file \"Computer file\") can be emailed to customers, colleagues and friends as an attachment. It can be uploaded to a website or [File Transfer Protocol](/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol \"File Transfer Protocol\") (FTP) server for easy download by others. It can be put into a \"shared location\" or onto a [file server](/wiki/File_server \"File server\") for instant use by colleagues. The load of bulk downloads to many users can be eased by the use of \"[mirror](/wiki/Web_mirror \"Web mirror\")\" servers or [peer-to-peer](/wiki/Peer-to-peer \"Peer-to-peer\") networks. In any of these cases, access to the file may be controlled by user [authentication](/wiki/Authentication \"Authentication\"), the transit of the file over the Internet may be obscured by [encryption](/wiki/Encryption \"Encryption\"), and money may change hands for access to the file. The price can be paid by the remote charging of funds from, for example, a credit card whose details are also passed—usually fully encrypted—across the Internet. The origin and authenticity of the file received may be checked by [digital signatures](/wiki/Digital_signature \"Digital signature\") or by [MD5](/wiki/MD5 \"MD5\") or other message digests. These simple features of the Internet, over a worldwide basis, are changing the production, sale, and distribution of anything that can be reduced to a computer file for transmission. This includes all manner of print publications, software products, news, music, film, video, photography, graphics and the other arts. This in turn has caused seismic shifts in each of the existing industries that previously controlled the production and distribution of these products.\n\n[Streaming media](/wiki/Streaming_media \"Streaming media\") is the real-time delivery of digital media for the immediate consumption or enjoyment by end users. Many radio and television broadcasters provide Internet feeds of their live audio and video productions. They may also allow time-shift viewing or listening such as Preview, Classic Clips and Listen Again features. These providers have been joined by a range of pure Internet \"broadcasters\" who never had on-air licenses. This means that an Internet-connected device, such as a computer or something more specific, can be used to access on-line media in much the same way as was previously possible only with a television or radio receiver. The range of available types of content is much wider, from specialized technical [webcasts](/wiki/Webcast \"Webcast\") to on-demand popular multimedia services. [Podcasting](/wiki/Podcast \"Podcast\") is a variation on this theme, where—usually audio—material is downloaded and played back on a computer or shifted to a [portable media player](/wiki/Portable_media_player \"Portable media player\") to be listened to on the move. These techniques using simple equipment allow anybody, with little censorship or licensing control, to broadcast audio-visual material worldwide.\n\nDigital media streaming increases the demand for network bandwidth. For example, standard image quality needs 1 Mbit/s link speed for SD 480p, HD 720p quality requires 2.5 Mbit/s, and the top-of-the-line HDX quality needs 4.5 Mbit/s for 1080p.[[80]](#cite_note-80)\n\n[Webcams](/wiki/Webcam \"Webcam\") are a low-cost extension of this phenomenon. While some webcams can give full-frame-rate video, the picture either is usually small or updates slowly. Internet users can watch animals around an African waterhole, ships in the [Panama Canal](/wiki/Panama_Canal \"Panama Canal\"), traffic at a local roundabout or monitor their own premises, live and in real time. Video [chat rooms](/wiki/Chat_rooms \"Chat rooms\") and [video conferencing](/wiki/Video_conferencing \"Video conferencing\") are also popular with many uses being found for personal webcams, with and without two-way sound. YouTube was founded on 15 February 2005 and is now the leading website for free streaming video with more than two billion users.[[81]](#cite_note-81) It uses an HTML5 based web player by default to stream and show video files.[[82]](#cite_note-82) Registered users may upload an unlimited amount of video and build their own personal profile. [YouTube](/wiki/YouTube \"YouTube\") claims that its users watch hundreds of millions, and upload hundreds of thousands of videos daily.\n\n## Social impact\n\nThe Internet has enabled new forms of social interaction, activities, and social associations. This phenomenon has given rise to the scholarly study of the [sociology of the Internet](/wiki/Sociology_of_the_Internet \"Sociology of the Internet\").\n\n### Users\n\nSee also: [Global Internet usage](/wiki/Global_Internet_usage \"Global Internet usage\"), [English in computing](/wiki/English_in_computing \"English in computing\"), and [Languages used on the Internet](/wiki/Languages_used_on_the_Internet \"Languages used on the Internet\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n![](/api/rest_v1/page/graph/png/Internet/0/48482e91f3853842d761cb77b014df3213997fc1.png)\n\n\n\n_►_\n\n\n\n\n\nSee or edit [source data](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Data:Share_of_population_using_the_Internet.tab \"c:Data:Share of population using the Internet.tab\").\n\nShare of population using the Internet[[83]](#cite_note-83)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/Internet_users_per_100_inhabitants_ITU.svg/290px-Internet_users_per_100_inhabitants_ITU.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Internet_users_per_100_inhabitants_ITU.svg)\n\n\n\n[](/wiki/File:Internet_users_per_100_inhabitants_ITU.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\n**Internet users per 100 inhabitants**\n\nSource: [International Telecommunications Union](/wiki/International_Telecommunications_Union \"International Telecommunications Union\").[[84]](#cite_note-84)[[85]](#cite_note-85)\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom 2000 to 2009, the number of Internet users globally rose from 394 million to 1.858 billion.[[86]](#cite_note-86) By 2010, 22 percent of the world's population had access to computers with 1 billion [Google](/wiki/Google \"Google\") searches every day, 300 million Internet users reading blogs, and 2 billion videos viewed daily on [YouTube](/wiki/YouTube \"YouTube\").[[87]](#cite_note-87) In 2014 the world's Internet users surpassed 3 billion or 43.6 percent of world population, but two-thirds of the users came from richest countries, with 78.0 percent of Europe countries population using the Internet, followed by 57.4 percent of the Americas.[[88]](#cite_note-88) However, by 2018, Asia alone accounted for 51% of all Internet users, with 2.2 billion out of the 4.3 billion Internet users in the world coming from that region. The number of China's Internet users surpassed a major milestone in 2018, when the country's Internet regulatory authority, China Internet Network Information Centre, announced that China had 802 million Internet users.[[89]](#cite_note-89) By 2019, China was the world's leading country in terms of Internet users, with more than 800 million users, followed closely by India, with some 700 million users, with the United States a distant third with 275 million users. However, in terms of penetration, China has[_[when?](/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Dates_and_numbers#Chronological_items \"Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers\")_] a 38.4% penetration rate compared to India's 40% and the United States's 80%.[[90]](#cite_note-90) As of 2020, it was estimated that 4.5 billion people use the Internet.[[91]](#cite_note-91)\n\nThe prevalent language for communication via the Internet has always been English. This may be a result of the origin of the Internet, as well as the language's role as a [lingua franca](/wiki/Lingua_franca \"Lingua franca\") and as a [world language](/wiki/World_language \"World language\"). Early computer systems were limited to the characters in the [American Standard Code for Information Interchange](/wiki/ASCII \"ASCII\") (ASCII), a subset of the [Latin alphabet](/wiki/Latin_alphabet \"Latin alphabet\").\n\nAfter English (27%), the most requested languages on the [World Wide Web](/wiki/World_Wide_Web \"World Wide Web\") are Chinese (25%), Spanish (8%), Japanese (5%), Portuguese and German (4% each), Arabic, French and Russian (3% each), and Korean (2%).[[92]](#cite_note-NIUBL-IWS-92) By region, 42% of the world's [Internet users](/wiki/Internet_users \"Internet users\") are based in Asia, 24% in Europe, 14% in North America, 10% in Latin America and the [Caribbean](/wiki/Caribbean \"Caribbean\") taken together, 6% in Africa, 3% in the Middle East and 1% in Australia/Oceania.[[93]](#cite_note-inetstats-93) The Internet's technologies have developed enough in recent years, especially in the use of [Unicode](/wiki/Unicode \"Unicode\"), that good facilities are available for development and communication in the world's widely used languages. However, some glitches such as _[mojibake](/wiki/Mojibake \"Mojibake\")_ (incorrect display of some languages' characters) still remain.\n\nIn an American study in 2005, the percentage of men using the Internet was very slightly ahead of the percentage of women, although this difference reversed in those under 30\\. Men logged on more often, spent more time online, and were more likely to be broadband users, whereas women tended to make more use of opportunities to communicate (such as email). Men were more likely to use the Internet to pay bills, participate in auctions, and for recreation such as downloading music and videos. Men and women were equally likely to use the Internet for shopping and banking.[[94]](#cite_note-94) More recent studies indicate that in 2008, women significantly outnumbered men on most [social networking services](/wiki/Social_networking_service \"Social networking service\"), such as Facebook and Myspace, although the ratios varied with age.[[95]](#cite_note-95) In addition, women watched more streaming content, whereas men downloaded more.[[96]](#cite_note-96) In terms of blogs, men were more likely to blog in the first place; among those who blog, men were more likely to have a professional blog, whereas women were more likely to have a personal blog.[[97]](#cite_note-97)\n\nSplitting by country, in 2012 Iceland, Norway, Sweden, the Netherlands, and Denmark had the highest [Internet penetration by the number of users](/wiki/List_of_countries_by_number_of_Internet_users \"List of countries by number of Internet users\"), with 93% or more of the population with access.[[98]](#cite_note-ITU-IndividualsUsingTheInternet-98)\n\nSeveral neologisms exist that refer to Internet users: [Netizen](/wiki/Netizen \"Netizen\") (as in \"citizen of the net\")[[99]](#cite_note-99) refers to those [actively involved](/wiki/Online_participation \"Online participation\") in improving [online communities](/wiki/Virtual_community \"Virtual community\"), the Internet in general or surrounding political affairs and rights such as [free speech](/wiki/Freedom_of_speech#The_Internet_and_Information_Society \"Freedom of speech\"),[[100]](#cite_note-100)[[101]](#cite_note-Hauben-101) [Internaut](/w/index.php?title=Internaut&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Internaut (page does not exist)\") refers to operators or technically highly capable users of the Internet,[[102]](#cite_note-102)[[103]](#cite_note-103) [digital citizen](/wiki/Digital_citizen \"Digital citizen\") refers to a person using the Internet in order to engage in society, politics, and government participation.[[104]](#cite_note-104)\n\n*   \n\n    \n\n    [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/InternetUsersByLanguagePieChart.svg/562px-InternetUsersByLanguagePieChart.svg.png)](/wiki/File:InternetUsersByLanguagePieChart.svg)\n\n    \n\n    \n\n    **[Internet users by language](/wiki/Languages_used_on_the_Internet \"Languages used on the Internet\")**[[92]](#cite_note-NIUBL-IWS-92)\n\n    \n\n    \n\n*   \n\n    \n\n    [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/WebsitesByLanguagePieChart.svg/562px-WebsitesByLanguagePieChart.svg.png)](/wiki/File:WebsitesByLanguagePieChart.svg)\n\n    \n\n    \n\n    **[Website content languages](/wiki/Languages_used_on_the_Internet \"Languages used on the Internet\")**[[105]](#cite_note-UofCLBWApril2013-105)\n\n    \n\n    \n\n### Usage\n\n\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/InternetPenetrationWorldMap.svg/360px-InternetPenetrationWorldMap.svg.png)](/wiki/File:InternetPenetrationWorldMap.svg)\n\n\n\n[](/wiki/File:InternetPenetrationWorldMap.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\n**[Internet users in 2015 as a percentage of a country's population](/wiki/List_of_countries_by_number_of_Internet_users \"List of countries by number of Internet users\")**\n\nSource: [International Telecommunications Union](/wiki/International_Telecommunications_Union \"International Telecommunications Union\").[[98]](#cite_note-ITU-IndividualsUsingTheInternet-98)\n\n\n\n\n\nMain articles: [Global digital divide](/wiki/Global_digital_divide \"Global digital divide\") and [Digital divide](/wiki/Digital_divide \"Digital divide\")\n\n\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f4/FixedBroadbandInternetPenetrationWorldMap.svg/360px-FixedBroadbandInternetPenetrationWorldMap.svg.png)](/wiki/File:FixedBroadbandInternetPenetrationWorldMap.svg)\n\n\n\n[](/wiki/File:FixedBroadbandInternetPenetrationWorldMap.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\n**[Fixed broadband Internet subscriptions in 2012](/wiki/List_of_countries_by_number_of_broadband_Internet_subscriptions \"List of countries by number of broadband Internet subscriptions\")  \nas a percentage of a country's population**\n\nSource: [International Telecommunications Union](/wiki/International_Telecommunications_Union \"International Telecommunications Union\").[[106]](#cite_note-FixedBroadbandITUDynamic2012-106)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bb/MobileBroadbandInternetPenetrationWorldMap.svg/360px-MobileBroadbandInternetPenetrationWorldMap.svg.png)](/wiki/File:MobileBroadbandInternetPenetrationWorldMap.svg)\n\n\n\n[](/wiki/File:MobileBroadbandInternetPenetrationWorldMap.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\n**[Mobile broadband Internet subscriptions in 2012](/wiki/List_of_countries_by_number_of_broadband_Internet_subscriptions \"List of countries by number of broadband Internet subscriptions\")  \nas a percentage of a country's population**\n\nSource: [International Telecommunications Union](/wiki/International_Telecommunications_Union \"International Telecommunications Union\").[[107]](#cite_note-MobleBroadbandITUDynamic2012-107)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Internet allows greater flexibility in working hours and location, especially with the spread of unmetered high-speed connections. The Internet can be accessed almost anywhere by numerous means, including through [mobile Internet devices](/wiki/Mobile_Internet_device \"Mobile Internet device\"). Mobile phones, [datacards](/wiki/Datacard \"Datacard\"), [handheld game consoles](/wiki/Handheld_game_console \"Handheld game console\") and [cellular routers](/wiki/Cellular_router \"Cellular router\") allow users to connect to the Internet [wirelessly](/wiki/Wireless \"Wireless\"). Within the limitations imposed by small screens and other limited facilities of such pocket-sized devices, the services of the Internet, including email and the web, may be available. Service providers may restrict the services offered and mobile data charges may be significantly higher than other access methods.\n\nEducational material at all levels from pre-school to post-doctoral is available from websites. Examples range from [CBeebies](/wiki/CBeebies \"CBeebies\"), through school and high-school revision guides and [virtual universities](/wiki/Virtual_university \"Virtual university\"), to access to top-end scholarly literature through the likes of [Google Scholar](/wiki/Google_Scholar \"Google Scholar\"). For [distance education](/wiki/Distance_education \"Distance education\"), help with [homework](/wiki/Homework \"Homework\") and other assignments, self-guided learning, whiling away spare time, or just looking up more detail on an interesting fact, it has never been easier for people to access educational information at any level from anywhere. The Internet in general and the [World Wide Web](/wiki/World_Wide_Web \"World Wide Web\") in particular are important enablers of both [formal](/wiki/Education \"Education\") and [informal education](/wiki/Informal_education \"Informal education\"). Further, the Internet allows universities, in particular, researchers from the social and behavioral sciences, to conduct research remotely via virtual laboratories, with profound changes in reach and generalizability of findings as well as in communication between scientists and in the publication of results.[[108]](#cite_note-108)\n\nThe low cost and nearly instantaneous sharing of ideas, knowledge, and skills have made [collaborative](/wiki/Collaboration \"Collaboration\") work dramatically easier, with the help of [collaborative software](/wiki/Collaborative_software \"Collaborative software\"). Not only can a group cheaply communicate and share ideas but the wide reach of the Internet allows such groups more easily to form. An example of this is the [free software movement](/wiki/Free_software_movement \"Free software movement\"), which has produced, among other things, [Linux](/wiki/Linux \"Linux\"), [Mozilla Firefox](/wiki/Mozilla_Firefox \"Mozilla Firefox\"), and [OpenOffice.org](/wiki/OpenOffice.org \"OpenOffice.org\") (later forked into [LibreOffice](/wiki/LibreOffice \"LibreOffice\")). Internet chat, whether using an [IRC](/wiki/IRC \"IRC\") chat room, an [instant messaging](/wiki/Instant_messaging \"Instant messaging\") system, or a [social networking service](/wiki/Social_networking_service \"Social networking service\"), allows colleagues to stay in touch in a very convenient way while working at their computers during the day. Messages can be exchanged even more quickly and conveniently than via email. These systems may allow files to be exchanged, drawings and images to be shared, or voice and video contact between team members.\n\n[Content management](/wiki/Content_management \"Content management\") systems allow collaborating teams to work on shared sets of documents simultaneously without accidentally destroying each other's work. Business and project teams can share calendars as well as documents and other information. Such collaboration occurs in a wide variety of areas including scientific research, software development, conference planning, political activism and creative writing. Social and political collaboration is also becoming more widespread as both Internet access and [computer literacy](/wiki/Computer_literacy \"Computer literacy\") spread.\n\nThe Internet allows computer users to remotely access other computers and information stores easily from any access point. Access may be with [computer security](/wiki/Computer_security \"Computer security\"), i.e. authentication and encryption technologies, depending on the requirements. This is encouraging new ways of working from home, collaboration and information sharing in many industries. An accountant sitting at home can [audit](/wiki/Audit \"Audit\") the books of a company based in another country, on a [server](/wiki/Server_(computing) \"Server (computing)\") situated in a third country that is remotely maintained by IT specialists in a fourth. These accounts could have been created by home-working bookkeepers, in other remote locations, based on information emailed to them from offices all over the world. Some of these things were possible before the widespread use of the Internet, but the cost of private [leased lines](/wiki/Leased_line \"Leased line\") would have made many of them infeasible in practice. An office worker away from their desk, perhaps on the other side of the world on a business trip or a holiday, can access their emails, access their data using [cloud computing](/wiki/Cloud_computing \"Cloud computing\"), or open a [remote desktop](/wiki/Remote_Desktop_Protocol \"Remote Desktop Protocol\") session into their office PC using a secure [virtual private network](/wiki/Virtual_private_network \"Virtual private network\") (VPN) connection on the Internet. This can give the worker complete access to all of their normal files and data, including email and other applications, while away from the office. It has been referred to among [system administrators](/wiki/System_administrator \"System administrator\") as the Virtual Private Nightmare,[[109]](#cite_note-109) because it extends the secure perimeter of a corporate network into remote locations and its employees' homes.\n\n### Social networking and entertainment\n\nSee also: [Social networking service § Social impact](/wiki/Social_networking_service#Social_impact \"Social networking service\")\n\nMany people use the World Wide Web to access news, weather and sports reports, to plan and book vacations and to pursue their personal interests. People use [chat](/wiki/Online_chat \"Online chat\"), messaging and email to make and stay in touch with friends worldwide, sometimes in the same way as some previously had [pen pals](/wiki/Pen_pal \"Pen pal\"). [Social networking services](/wiki/Social_networking_service \"Social networking service\") such as [Facebook](/wiki/Facebook \"Facebook\") have created new ways to socialize and interact. Users of these sites are able to add a wide variety of information to pages, to pursue common interests, and to connect with others. It is also possible to find existing acquaintances, to allow communication among existing groups of people. Sites like [LinkedIn](/wiki/LinkedIn \"LinkedIn\") foster commercial and business connections. YouTube and [Flickr](/wiki/Flickr \"Flickr\") specialize in users' videos and photographs. [Social networking services](/wiki/Social_networking_service \"Social networking service\") are also widely used by businesses and other organizations to promote their brands, to market to their customers and to encourage posts to \"[go viral](/wiki/Viral_marketing \"Viral marketing\")\". \"Black hat\" social media techniques are also employed by some organizations, such as [spam](/wiki/Spamming \"Spamming\") accounts and [astroturfing](/wiki/Astroturfing \"Astroturfing\").\n\nA risk for both individuals and organizations writing posts (especially public posts) on [social networking services](/wiki/Social_networking_service \"Social networking service\"), is that especially foolish or controversial posts occasionally lead to an unexpected and possibly large-scale backlash on social media from other Internet users. This is also a risk in relation to controversial _offline_ behavior, if it is widely made known. The nature of this backlash can range widely from counter-arguments and public mockery, through insults and [hate speech](/wiki/Hate_speech \"Hate speech\"), to, in extreme cases, rape and death [threats](/wiki/Computer_crime#Threats \"Computer crime\"). The [online disinhibition effect](/wiki/Online_disinhibition_effect \"Online disinhibition effect\") describes the tendency of many individuals to behave more stridently or offensively online than they would in person. A significant number of [feminist](/wiki/Feminist \"Feminist\") women have been the target of various forms of [harassment](/wiki/Harassment \"Harassment\") in response to posts they have made on social media, and Twitter in particular has been criticised in the past for not doing enough to aid victims of online abuse.[[110]](#cite_note-110)\n\nFor organizations, such a backlash can cause overall [brand damage](/wiki/Public_relations \"Public relations\"), especially if reported by the media. However, this is not always the case, as any brand damage in the eyes of people with an opposing opinion to that presented by the organization could sometimes be outweighed by strengthening the brand in the eyes of others. Furthermore, if an organization or individual gives in to demands that others perceive as wrong-headed, that can then provoke a counter-backlash.\n\nSome websites, such as [Reddit](/wiki/Reddit \"Reddit\"), have rules forbidding the posting of [personal information](/wiki/Personal_information \"Personal information\") of individuals (also known as [doxxing](/wiki/Doxxing \"Doxxing\")), due to concerns about such postings leading to mobs of large numbers of Internet users directing harassment at the specific individuals thereby identified. In particular, the Reddit rule forbidding the posting of personal information is widely understood to imply that all identifying photos and names must be [censored](/wiki/Censored \"Censored\") in Facebook [screenshots](/wiki/Screenshots \"Screenshots\") posted to Reddit. However, the interpretation of this rule in relation to public Twitter posts is less clear, and in any case, like-minded people online have many other ways they can use to direct each other's attention to public social media posts they disagree with.\n\nChildren also face dangers online such as [cyberbullying](/wiki/Cyberbullying \"Cyberbullying\") and [approaches by sexual predators](/wiki/Child_grooming \"Child grooming\"), who sometimes pose as children themselves. Children may also encounter material which they may find upsetting, or material which their parents consider to be not age-appropriate. Due to naivety, they may also post personal information about themselves online, which could put them or their families at risk unless warned not to do so. Many parents choose to enable [Internet filtering](/wiki/Content-control_software \"Content-control software\"), and/or supervise their children's online activities, in an attempt to protect their children from inappropriate material on the Internet. The most popular [social networking services](/wiki/Social_networking_service \"Social networking service\"), such as Facebook and Twitter, commonly forbid users under the age of 13\\. However, these policies are typically trivial to circumvent by registering an account with a false birth date, and a significant number of children aged under 13 join such sites anyway. [Social networking services](/wiki/Social_networking_service \"Social networking service\") for younger children, which claim to provide better levels of protection for children, also exist.[[111]](#cite_note-111)\n\nThe Internet has been a major outlet for leisure activity since its inception, with entertaining [social experiments](/wiki/Social_experiment \"Social experiment\") such as [MUDs](/wiki/MUD \"MUD\") and [MOOs](/wiki/MOO \"MOO\") being conducted on university servers, and humor-related [Usenet](/wiki/Usenet \"Usenet\") groups receiving much traffic.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] Many [Internet forums](/wiki/Internet_forums \"Internet forums\") have sections devoted to games and funny videos.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] The [Internet pornography](/wiki/Internet_pornography \"Internet pornography\") and [online gambling](/wiki/Online_gambling \"Online gambling\") industries have taken advantage of the World Wide Web. Although many governments have attempted to restrict both industries' use of the Internet, in general, this has failed to stop their widespread popularity.[[112]](#cite_note-112)\n\nAnother area of leisure activity on the Internet is [multiplayer gaming](/wiki/Multiplayer_gaming \"Multiplayer gaming\").[[113]](#cite_note-113) This form of recreation creates communities, where people of all ages and origins enjoy the fast-paced world of multiplayer games. These range from [MMORPG](/wiki/MMORPG \"MMORPG\") to [first-person shooters](/wiki/First-person_shooter \"First-person shooter\"), from [role-playing video games](/wiki/Role-playing_video_game \"Role-playing video game\") to [online gambling](/wiki/Online_gambling \"Online gambling\"). While online gaming has been around since the 1970s, modern modes of online gaming began with subscription services such as [GameSpy](/wiki/GameSpy_Arcade \"GameSpy Arcade\") and [MPlayer](/wiki/MPlayer.com \"MPlayer.com\").[[114]](#cite_note-114) Non-subscribers were limited to certain types of game play or certain games. Many people use the Internet to access and download music, movies and other works for their enjoyment and relaxation. Free and fee-based services exist for all of these activities, using centralized servers and distributed peer-to-peer technologies. Some of these sources exercise more care with respect to the original artists' copyrights than others.\n\nInternet usage has been correlated to users' loneliness.[[115]](#cite_note-115) Lonely people tend to use the Internet as an outlet for their feelings and to share their stories with others, such as in the \"[I am lonely will anyone speak to me](/wiki/I_am_lonely_will_anyone_speak_to_me \"I am lonely will anyone speak to me\")\" thread.\n\nA 2017 book claimed that the Internet consolidates most aspects of human endeavor into singular arenas of which all of humanity are potential members and competitors, with fundamentally negative impacts on mental health as a result. While successes in each field of activity are pervasively visible and trumpeted, they are reserved for an extremely thin sliver of the world's most exceptional, leaving everyone else behind. Whereas, before the Internet, expectations of success in any field were supported by reasonable probabilities of achievement at the village, suburb, city or even state level, the same expectations in the Internet world are virtually certain to bring disappointment today: there is always someone else, somewhere on the planet, who can do better and take the now one-and-only top spot.[[116]](#cite_note-116)\n\n[Cybersectarianism](/wiki/Cybersectarianism \"Cybersectarianism\") is a new organizational form which involves: \"highly dispersed small groups of practitioners that may remain largely anonymous within the larger social context and operate in relative secrecy, while still linked remotely to a larger network of believers who share a set of practices and texts, and often a common devotion to a particular leader. Overseas supporters provide funding and support; domestic practitioners distribute tracts, participate in acts of resistance, and share information on the internal situation with outsiders. Collectively, members and practitioners of such sects construct viable virtual communities of faith, exchanging personal testimonies and engaging in the collective study via email, on-line chat rooms, and web-based message boards.\"[[117]](#cite_note-117) In particular, the British government has raised concerns about the prospect of young British Muslims being indoctrinated into Islamic extremism by material on the Internet, being persuaded to join [terrorist](/wiki/Terrorist \"Terrorist\") groups such as the so-called \"[Islamic State](/wiki/Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant \"Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\")\", and then potentially committing acts of terrorism on returning to Britain after fighting in Syria or Iraq.\n\n[Cyberslacking](/wiki/Cyberslacking \"Cyberslacking\") can become a drain on corporate resources; the average UK employee spent 57 minutes a day surfing the Web while at work, according to a 2003 study by Peninsula Business Services.[[118]](#cite_note-118) [Internet addiction disorder](/wiki/Internet_addiction_disorder \"Internet addiction disorder\") is excessive computer use that interferes with daily life. [Nicholas G. Carr](/wiki/Nicholas_G._Carr \"Nicholas G. Carr\") believes that Internet use has other [effects on individuals](/wiki/Psychological_effects_of_Internet_use \"Psychological effects of Internet use\"), for instance improving skills of scan-reading and [interfering](/wiki/Interference_theory \"Interference theory\") with the deep thinking that leads to true creativity.[[119]](#cite_note-119)\n\n### Electronic business\n\n[Electronic business](/wiki/Electronic_business \"Electronic business\") (_e-business_) encompasses business processes spanning the entire [value chain](/wiki/Value_chain \"Value chain\"): purchasing, [supply chain management](/wiki/Supply_chain_management \"Supply chain management\"), [marketing](/wiki/Marketing \"Marketing\"), [sales](/wiki/Sales \"Sales\"), [customer](/wiki/Customer \"Customer\") service, and business relationship. [E-commerce](/wiki/E-commerce \"E-commerce\") seeks to add revenue streams using the Internet to build and enhance relationships with clients and partners. According to [International Data Corporation](/wiki/International_Data_Corporation \"International Data Corporation\"), the size of worldwide e-commerce, when global business-to-business and -consumer transactions are combined, equate to $16 trillion for 2013\\. A report by Oxford Economics added those two together to estimate the total size of the [digital economy](/wiki/Digital_economy \"Digital economy\") at $20.4 trillion, equivalent to roughly 13.8% of global sales.[[120]](#cite_note-120)\n\nWhile much has been written of the economic advantages of [Internet-enabled commerce](/wiki/Electronic_commerce \"Electronic commerce\"), there is also evidence that some aspects of the Internet such as maps and location-aware services may serve to reinforce [economic inequality](/wiki/Economic_inequality \"Economic inequality\") and the [digital divide](/wiki/Digital_divide \"Digital divide\").[[121]](#cite_note-121) Electronic commerce may be responsible for [consolidation](/wiki/Consolidation_(business) \"Consolidation (business)\") and the decline of [mom-and-pop](/wiki/Mom-and-pop \"Mom-and-pop\"), [brick and mortar](/wiki/Brick_and_mortar \"Brick and mortar\") businesses resulting in increases in [income inequality](/wiki/Income_inequality \"Income inequality\").[[122]](#cite_note-122)[[123]](#cite_note-123)[[124]](#cite_note-124)\n\nAuthor [Andrew Keen](/wiki/Andrew_Keen \"Andrew Keen\"), a long-time critic of the social transformations caused by the Internet, has focused on the economic effects of consolidation from Internet businesses. Keen cites a 2013 [Institute for Local Self-Reliance](/wiki/Institute_for_Local_Self-Reliance \"Institute for Local Self-Reliance\") report saying brick-and-mortar retailers employ 47 people for every $10 million in sales while Amazon employs only 14\\. Similarly, the 700-employee room rental start-up [Airbnb](/wiki/Airbnb \"Airbnb\") was valued at $10 billion in 2014, about half as much as [Hilton Worldwide](/wiki/Hilton_Worldwide \"Hilton Worldwide\"), which employs 152,000 people. At that time, [Uber](/wiki/Uber \"Uber\") employed 1,000 full-time employees and was valued at $18.2 billion, about the same valuation as [Avis Rent a Car](/wiki/Avis_Rent_a_Car \"Avis Rent a Car\") and [The Hertz Corporation](/wiki/The_Hertz_Corporation \"The Hertz Corporation\") combined, which together employed almost 60,000 people.[[125]](#cite_note-125)\n\n### Telecommuting\n\n[Telecommuting](/wiki/Telecommuting \"Telecommuting\") is the performance within a traditional worker and employer relationship when it is facilitated by tools such as [groupware](/wiki/Groupware \"Groupware\"), [virtual private networks](/wiki/Virtual_private_networks \"Virtual private networks\"), [conference calling](/wiki/Conference_calling \"Conference calling\"), [videoconferencing](/wiki/Videoconferencing \"Videoconferencing\"), and [voice over IP](/wiki/Voice_over_IP \"Voice over IP\") (VOIP) so that work may be performed from any location, most conveniently the worker's home. It can be efficient and useful for companies as it allows workers to communicate over long distances, saving significant amounts of travel time and cost. As [broadband](/wiki/Broadband \"Broadband\") Internet connections become commonplace, more workers have adequate bandwidth at home to use these tools to link their home to their corporate [intranet](/wiki/Intranet \"Intranet\") and internal communication networks.\n\n### Collaborative publishing\n\n[Wikis](/wiki/Wiki \"Wiki\") have also been used in the academic community for sharing and dissemination of information across institutional and international boundaries.[[126]](#cite_note-126) In those settings, they have been found useful for collaboration on [grant writing](/wiki/Grant_writing \"Grant writing\"), [strategic planning](/wiki/Strategic_planning \"Strategic planning\"), departmental documentation, and committee work.[[127]](#cite_note-127) The [United States Patent and Trademark Office](/wiki/United_States_Patent_and_Trademark_Office \"United States Patent and Trademark Office\") uses a wiki to allow the public to collaborate on finding [prior art](/wiki/Prior_art \"Prior art\") relevant to examination of pending patent applications. [Queens](/wiki/Queens \"Queens\"), New York has used a wiki to allow citizens to collaborate on the design and planning of a local park.[[128]](#cite_note-Noveck-128) The [English Wikipedia](/wiki/English_Wikipedia \"English Wikipedia\") has the largest user base among wikis on the World Wide Web[[129]](#cite_note-129) and ranks in the top 10 among all Web sites in terms of traffic.[[130]](#cite_note-130)\n\n### Politics and political revolutions\n\nSee also: [Internet censorship](/wiki/Internet_censorship \"Internet censorship\"), [Mass surveillance](/wiki/Mass_surveillance \"Mass surveillance\"), and [Social media use in politics](/wiki/Social_media_use_in_politics \"Social media use in politics\")\n\n\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/Thai-coup-detat-2014-social-media-banner.jpg/220px-Thai-coup-detat-2014-social-media-banner.jpg)](/wiki/File:Thai-coup-detat-2014-social-media-banner.jpg)\n\n\n\n[](/wiki/File:Thai-coup-detat-2014-social-media-banner.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nBanner in [Bangkok](/wiki/Bangkok \"Bangkok\") during the [2014 Thai coup d'état](/wiki/2014_Thai_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat \"2014 Thai coup d'état\"), informing the [Thai](/wiki/Thailand \"Thailand\") public that 'like' or 'share' activities on social media could result in imprisonment (observed 30 June 2014).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Internet has achieved new relevance as a political tool. The presidential campaign of [Howard Dean](/wiki/Howard_Dean \"Howard Dean\") in 2004 in the United States was notable for its success in soliciting donation via the Internet. Many political groups use the Internet to achieve a new method of organizing for carrying out their mission, having given rise to [Internet activism](/wiki/Internet_activism \"Internet activism\"), most notably practiced by rebels in the [Arab Spring](/wiki/Arab_Spring \"Arab Spring\").[[131]](#cite_note-cascading-131)[[132]](#cite_note-132) _[The New York Times](/wiki/The_New_York_Times \"The New York Times\")_ suggested that [social media](/wiki/Social_media \"Social media\") websites, such as Facebook and Twitter, helped people organize the political revolutions in Egypt, by helping activists organize protests, communicate grievances, and disseminate information.[[133]](#cite_note-133)\n\nMany have understood the Internet as an extension of the [Habermasian](/wiki/J%C3%BCrgen_Habermas \"Jürgen Habermas\") notion of the _[public sphere](/wiki/Public_sphere \"Public sphere\")_, observing how network communication technologies provide something like a global civic forum. However, incidents of politically motivated [Internet censorship](/wiki/Internet_censorship \"Internet censorship\") have now been recorded in many countries, including western democracies.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n### Philanthropy\n\nThe spread of low-cost Internet access in developing countries has opened up new possibilities for [peer-to-peer](/wiki/Social_peer-to-peer_processes \"Social peer-to-peer processes\") charities, which allow individuals to contribute small amounts to charitable projects for other individuals. Websites, such as [DonorsChoose](/wiki/DonorsChoose \"DonorsChoose\") and [GlobalGiving](/wiki/GlobalGiving \"GlobalGiving\"), allow small-scale donors to direct funds to individual projects of their choice. A popular twist on Internet-based philanthropy is the use of [peer-to-peer lending](/wiki/Peer-to-peer_lending \"Peer-to-peer lending\") for charitable purposes. [Kiva](/wiki/Kiva_(organization) \"Kiva (organization)\") pioneered this concept in 2005, offering the first web-based service to publish individual loan profiles for funding. Kiva raises funds for local intermediary [microfinance](/wiki/Microfinance \"Microfinance\") organizations which post stories and updates on behalf of the borrowers. Lenders can contribute as little as $25 to loans of their choice, and receive their money back as borrowers repay. Kiva falls short of being a pure peer-to-peer charity, in that loans are disbursed before being funded by lenders and borrowers do not communicate with lenders themselves.[[134]](#cite_note-134)[[135]](#cite_note-135)\n\n## Security\n\nMain article: [Internet security](/wiki/Internet_security \"Internet security\")\n\nInternet resources, hardware, and software components are the target of criminal or malicious attempts to gain unauthorized control to cause interruptions, commit fraud, engage in blackmail or access private information.\n\n### Malware\n\n[Malware](/wiki/Malware \"Malware\") is malicious software used and distributed via the Internet. It includes [computer viruses](/wiki/Computer_virus \"Computer virus\") which are copied with the help of humans, [computer worms](/wiki/Computer_worm \"Computer worm\") which copy themselves automatically, software for [denial of service attacks](/wiki/Denial_of_service_attack \"Denial of service attack\"), [ransomware](/wiki/Ransomware \"Ransomware\"), [botnets](/wiki/Botnet \"Botnet\"), and [spyware](/wiki/Spyware \"Spyware\") that reports on the activity and typing of users. Usually, these activities constitute [cybercrime](/wiki/Cybercrime \"Cybercrime\"). Defense theorists have also speculated about the possibilities of [hackers](/wiki/Hackers \"Hackers\") using [cyber warfare](/wiki/Cyber_warfare \"Cyber warfare\") using similar methods on a large scale.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n### Surveillance\n\nMain article: [Computer and network surveillance](/wiki/Computer_and_network_surveillance \"Computer and network surveillance\")\n\nSee also: [Signals intelligence](/wiki/Signals_intelligence \"Signals intelligence\") and [Mass surveillance](/wiki/Mass_surveillance \"Mass surveillance\")\n\nThe vast majority of computer surveillance involves the monitoring of [data](/wiki/Data_mining \"Data mining\") and [traffic](/wiki/Traffic_analysis \"Traffic analysis\") on the Internet.[[136]](#cite_note-sciam-internet-136) In the United States for example, under the [Communications Assistance For Law Enforcement Act](/wiki/Communications_Assistance_For_Law_Enforcement_Act \"Communications Assistance For Law Enforcement Act\"), all phone calls and broadband Internet traffic (emails, web traffic, instant messaging, etc.) are required to be available for unimpeded real-time monitoring by Federal law enforcement agencies.[[137]](#cite_note-eff-calea-archive-137)[[138]](#cite_note-eff-calea-summary-138)[[139]](#cite_note-eff-calea-faq-139) [Packet capture](/wiki/Packet_capture \"Packet capture\") is the monitoring of data traffic on a [computer network](/wiki/Computer_network \"Computer network\"). Computers communicate over the Internet by breaking up messages (emails, images, videos, web pages, files, etc.) into small chunks called \"packets\", which are routed through a network of computers, until they reach their destination, where they are assembled back into a complete \"message\" again. [Packet Capture Appliance](/wiki/Packet_Capture_Appliance \"Packet Capture Appliance\") intercepts these packets as they are traveling through the network, in order to examine their contents using other programs. A packet capture is an information _gathering_ tool, but not an _analysis_ tool. That is it gathers \"messages\" but it does not analyze them and figure out what they mean. Other programs are needed to perform [traffic analysis](/wiki/Traffic_analysis \"Traffic analysis\") and sift through intercepted data looking for important/useful information. Under the [Communications Assistance For Law Enforcement Act](/wiki/Communications_Assistance_For_Law_Enforcement_Act \"Communications Assistance For Law Enforcement Act\") all U.S. telecommunications providers are required to install packet sniffing technology to allow Federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies to intercept all of their customers' [broadband Internet](/wiki/Broadband_Internet \"Broadband Internet\") and [voice over Internet protocol](/wiki/Voice_over_Internet_protocol \"Voice over Internet protocol\") (VoIP) traffic.[[140]](#cite_note-140)\n\nThe large amount of data gathered from packet capturing requires surveillance software that filters and reports relevant information, such as the use of certain words or phrases, the access of certain types of web sites, or communicating via email or chat with certain parties.[[141]](#cite_note-usatoday-chatroom-141) Agencies, such as the [Information Awareness Office](/wiki/Information_Awareness_Office \"Information Awareness Office\"), [NSA](/wiki/NSA \"NSA\"), [GCHQ](/wiki/GCHQ \"GCHQ\") and the [FBI](/wiki/FBI \"FBI\"), spend billions of dollars per year to develop, purchase, implement, and operate systems for interception and analysis of data.[[142]](#cite_note-zdnet-fbi-142) Similar systems are operated by [Iranian secret police](/wiki/Ministry_of_Intelligence_and_National_Security_of_Iran \"Ministry of Intelligence and National Security of Iran\") to identify and suppress dissidents. The required hardware and software was allegedly installed by German [Siemens AG](/wiki/Siemens_AG \"Siemens AG\") and Finnish [Nokia](/wiki/Nokia \"Nokia\").[[143]](#cite_note-143)\n\n### Censorship\n\nMain articles: [Internet censorship](/wiki/Internet_censorship \"Internet censorship\") and [Internet freedom](/wiki/Internet_freedom \"Internet freedom\")\n\nSee also: [Culture of fear](/wiki/Culture_of_fear \"Culture of fear\") and [Great Firewall](/wiki/Great_Firewall \"Great Firewall\")\n\n\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/Internet_Censorship_and_Surveillance_World_Map.svg/400px-Internet_Censorship_and_Surveillance_World_Map.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Internet_Censorship_and_Surveillance_World_Map.svg)\n\n\n\n[](/wiki/File:Internet_Censorship_and_Surveillance_World_Map.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\n**[Internet censorship and surveillance by country](/wiki/Internet_censorship_by_country \"Internet censorship by country\") (2018)**[[144]](#cite_note-FOTN-2018-144)[[145]](#cite_note-ONISS-Nov2011-145)[[146]](#cite_note-ONIChildPornLegal-146)[[147]](#cite_note-RWBEnemies2014-147)[[148]](#cite_note-RWBEnemies-148)\n\n>   Pervasive\n> \n> \n> \n>   Substantial\n> \n> \n> \n>   Selective\n> \n> \n> \n>   Little or none\n> \n> \n> \n> \n> \n> \n> \n>   Unclassified / No data\n> \n> \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome governments, such as those of [Burma](/wiki/Burma \"Burma\"), [Iran](/wiki/Iran \"Iran\"), [North Korea](/wiki/Censorship_in_North_Korea \"Censorship in North Korea\"), [Mainland China](/wiki/Censorship_in_China \"Censorship in China\"), [Saudi Arabia](/wiki/Saudi_Arabia \"Saudi Arabia\") and the [United Arab Emirates](/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates \"United Arab Emirates\"), restrict access to content on the Internet within their territories, especially to political and religious content, with domain name and keyword filters.[[149]](#cite_note-149)\n\nIn Norway, Denmark, Finland, and Sweden, major Internet service providers have voluntarily agreed to restrict access to sites listed by authorities. While this list of forbidden resources is supposed to contain only known child pornography sites, the content of the list is secret.[[150]](#cite_note-The_Register-150) Many countries, including the United States, have enacted laws against the possession or distribution of certain material, such as [child pornography](/wiki/Child_pornography \"Child pornography\"), via the Internet, but do not mandate filter software. Many free or commercially available software programs, called [content-control software](/wiki/Content-control_software \"Content-control software\") are available to users to block offensive websites on individual computers or networks, in order to limit access by children to pornographic material or depiction of violence.\n\n## Performance\n\nAs the Internet is a heterogeneous network, the physical characteristics, including for example the [data transfer rates](/wiki/Bit_rate \"Bit rate\") of connections, vary widely. It exhibits [emergent phenomena](/wiki/Emergence#World_Wide_Web_and_the_Internet \"Emergence\") that depend on its large-scale organization.[[151]](#cite_note-151)\n\n### Traffic volume\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Global Internet Traffic**\n\n![](/api/rest_v1/page/graph/png/Internet/0/8e8a9e85b35e959b1acaf7863ed42a5be56f0b07.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe volume of [Internet traffic](/wiki/Internet_traffic \"Internet traffic\") is difficult to measure, because no single point of measurement exists in the multi-tiered, non-hierarchical topology. Traffic data may be estimated from the aggregate volume through the peering points of the [Tier 1 network](/wiki/Tier_1_network \"Tier 1 network\") providers, but traffic that stays local in large provider networks may not be accounted for.\n\n### Outages\n\nAn Internet blackout or outage can be caused by local signalling interruptions. Disruptions of [submarine communications cables](/wiki/Submarine_communications_cable \"Submarine communications cable\") may cause blackouts or slowdowns to large areas, such as in the [2008 submarine cable disruption](/wiki/2008_submarine_cable_disruption \"2008 submarine cable disruption\"). Less-developed countries are more vulnerable due to a small number of high-capacity links. Land cables are also vulnerable, as in 2011 when a woman digging for scrap metal severed most connectivity for the nation of Armenia.[[152]](#cite_note-152) Internet blackouts affecting almost entire countries can be achieved by governments as a form of [Internet censorship](/wiki/Internet_censorship \"Internet censorship\"), as in the blockage of the [Internet in Egypt](/wiki/Internet_in_Egypt \"Internet in Egypt\"), whereby approximately 93%[[153]](#cite_note-renesys1-153) of networks were without access in 2011 in an attempt to stop mobilization for [anti-government protests](/wiki/Egyptian_Revolution_of_2011 \"Egyptian Revolution of 2011\").[[154]](#cite_note-154)\n\n### Energy use\n\nEstimates of the Internet's electricity usage have been the subject of controversy, according to a 2014 peer-reviewed research paper that found claims differing by a factor of 20,000 published in the literature during the preceding decade, ranging from 0.0064 kilowatt hours per gigabyte transferred (kWh/GB) to 136 kWh/GB.[[155]](#cite_note-:3-155) The researchers attributed these discrepancies mainly to the year of reference (i.e. whether efficiency gains over time had been taken into account) and to whether \"end devices such as personal computers and servers are included\" in the analysis.[[155]](#cite_note-:3-155)\n\nIn 2011, academic researchers estimated the overall energy used by the Internet to be between 170 and 307 GW, less than two percent of the energy used by humanity. This estimate included the energy needed to build, operate, and periodically replace the estimated 750 million laptops, a billion smart phones and 100 million servers worldwide as well as the energy that routers, cell towers, optical switches, Wi-Fi transmitters and cloud storage devices use when transmitting Internet traffic.[[156]](#cite_note-156)[[157]](#cite_note-157) According to a non-peer reviewed study published in 2018 by [The Shift Project](/wiki/The_Shift_Project \"The Shift Project\") (a French think tank funded by corporate sponsors), nearly 4% of global CO2 emissions could be attributed to global data transfer and the necessary infrastructure.[[158]](#cite_note-158) The study also said that [online video streaming](/wiki/Internet_video \"Internet video\") alone accounted for 60% of this data transfer and therefore contributed to over 300 million tons of CO2 emission per year, and argued for new \"digital sobriety\" regulations restricting the use and size of video files.[[159]](#cite_note-159)\n\n## See also\n\n*   [![icon](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/Crystal_Clear_app_linneighborhood.svg/28px-Crystal_Clear_app_linneighborhood.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Crystal_Clear_app_linneighborhood.svg)[Internet portal](/wiki/Portal:Internet \"Portal:Internet\")\n\n\n\n\n\n*   [Crowdfunding](/wiki/Crowdfunding \"Crowdfunding\")\n*   [Crowdsourcing](/wiki/Crowdsourcing \"Crowdsourcing\")\n*   [Darknet](/wiki/Darknet \"Darknet\")\n*   [Deep web](/wiki/Deep_web \"Deep web\")\n*   [Freenet](/wiki/Freenet \"Freenet\")\n*   [Index of Internet-related articles](/wiki/Index_of_Internet-related_articles \"Index of Internet-related articles\")\n*   [Internet metaphors](/wiki/Internet_metaphors \"Internet metaphors\")\n*   [Internet video](/wiki/Internet_video \"Internet video\")\n*   \"[Internets](/wiki/Internets \"Internets\")\"\n*   [Open Systems Interconnection](/wiki/Open_Systems_Interconnection \"Open Systems Interconnection\")\n*   [Outline of the Internet](/wiki/Outline_of_the_Internet \"Outline of the Internet\")\n\n\n\n## References\n\n\n\n1.  ^ [Jump up to: _**a**_](#cite_ref-:4_1-0) [_**b**_](#cite_ref-:4_1-1) [\"A Flaw in the Design\"](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/business/2015/05/30/net-of-insecurity-part-1/). _The Washington Post_. 30 May 2015\\.

    "content": "**ASP.NET Core** is a [free and open-source](/wiki/Free_and_open-source \"Free and open-source\") [web framework](/wiki/Web_framework \"Web framework\") and successor to [ASP.NET](/wiki/ASP.NET \"ASP.NET\"),[[3]](#cite_note-3) developed by [Microsoft](/wiki/Microsoft \"Microsoft\").[[4]](#cite_note-4) It is a modular framework that runs on both the full [.NET Framework](/wiki/.NET_Framework \".NET Framework\"), on [Windows](/wiki/Windows \"Windows\"), and the [cross-platform](/wiki/Cross-platform \"Cross-platform\") [.NET Core](/wiki/.NET_Core \".NET Core\"). However ASP.NET Core version 3 works only on .NET Core dropping support of .NET Framework.[[5]](#cite_note-5)\n\nThe framework is a complete rewrite that unites the previously separate [ASP.NET MVC](/wiki/ASP.NET_MVC \"ASP.NET MVC\") and [ASP.NET Web API](/wiki/ASP.NET_Web_API \"ASP.NET Web API\") into a single [programming model](/wiki/Programming_model \"Programming model\").\n\nDespite being a new framework, built on a new web stack, it does have a high degree of concept compatibility with ASP.NET. ASP.NET Core applications supports side by side versioning in which different applications, running on the same machine, can target different versions of ASP.NET Core. This is not possible with previous versions of ASP.NET. Developers can build new web applications by following the MVC architectural pattern and can create a new project in MS Visual Studio 2019 by using ASP.NET Core Web Application template.

The size of the routing prefix of the address is designated in [CIDR notation](/wiki/CIDR_notation \"CIDR notation\") by suffixing the address with the number of [significant bits](/wiki/Bit_numbering \"Bit numbering\"), e.g., _192.168.1.15/24_, which is equivalent to the historically used [subnet mask](/wiki/Subnet_mask \"Subnet mask\") _255.255.255.0_.\n\nThe IP address space is managed globally by the [Internet Assigned Numbers Authority](/wiki/Internet_Assigned_Numbers_Authority \"Internet Assigned Numbers Authority\") (IANA), and by five [regional Internet registries](/wiki/Regional_Internet_registry \"Regional Internet registry\") (RIRs) responsible in their designated territories for assignment to [local Internet registries](/wiki/Local_Internet_registry \"Local Internet registry\"), such as [Internet service providers](/wiki/Internet_service_providers \"Internet service providers\") (ISPs), and other [end users](/wiki/End_user \"End user\"). IPv4 addresses were distributed by IANA to the RIRs in blocks of approximately 16.8 million addresses each, but have been exhausted at the IANA level since 2011\\. Only one of the RIRs still has a supply for local assignments in Africa.[[6]](#cite_note-6) Some IPv4 addresses are reserved for [private networks](/wiki/Private_network \"Private network\") and are not globally unique.\n\n[Network administrators](/wiki/Network_administrator \"Network administrator\") assign an IP address to each device connected to a network. Such assignments may be on a _static_ (fixed or permanent) or _dynamic_ basis, depending on network practices and [software](/wiki/Software \"Software\") features.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Contents\n\n\n\n*   [1 Function](#Function)\n*   [2 IP versions](#IP_versions)\n*   [3 Subnetworks](#Subnetworks)\n*   [4 IPv4 addresses](#IPv4_addresses)\n    *   [4.1 Subnetting history](#Subnetting_history)\n    *   [4.2 Private addresses](#Private_addresses)\n*   [5 IPv6 addresses](#IPv6_addresses)\n    *   [5.1 Private addresses](#Private_addresses_2)\n*   [6 IP address assignment](#IP_address_assignment)\n    *   [6.1 Sticky dynamic IP address](#Sticky_dynamic_IP_address)\n    *   [6.2 Address autoconfiguration](#Address_autoconfiguration)\n    *   [6.3 Addressing conflicts](#Addressing_conflicts)\n*   [7 Routing](#Routing)\n    *   [7.1 Unicast addressing](#Unicast_addressing)\n    *   [7.2 Broadcast addressing](#Broadcast_addressing)\n    *   [7.3 Multicast addressing](#Multicast_addressing)\n    *   [7.4 Anycast addressing](#Anycast_addressing)\n*   [8 Geolocation](#Geolocation)\n*   [9 Public address](#Public_address)\n*   [10 Firewalling](#Firewalling)\n*   [11 Address translation](#Address_translation)\n*   [12 Diagnostic tools](#Diagnostic_tools)\n*   [13 See also](#See_also)\n*   [14 References](#References)\n\n\n\n## Function\n\nAn IP address serves two principal functions. It [identifies](/wiki/Identification_(information) \"Identification (information)\") the host, or more specifically its network interface, and it provides the location of the host in the network, and thus the capability of establishing a path to that host. Its role has been characterized as follows: \"A name indicates what we seek. An address indicates where it is. A route indicates how to get there.\"[[2]](#cite_note-rfc791-2) The [header](/wiki/Header_(computing) \"Header (computing)\") of each [IP packet](/wiki/Network_packet \"Network packet\") contains the IP address of the sending host, and that of the destination host.\n\n## IP versions\n\nTwo [versions of the Internet Protocol](/wiki/Internet_Protocol#Version_history \"Internet Protocol\") are in common use on the Internet today. The original version of the Internet Protocol that was first deployed in 1983 in the [ARPANET](/wiki/ARPANET \"ARPANET\"), the predecessor of the Internet, is [Internet Protocol version 4](/wiki/IPv4 \"IPv4\") (IPv4).\n\nThe rapid [exhaustion of IPv4 address space](/wiki/IPv4_address_exhaustion \"IPv4 address exhaustion\") available for assignment to [Internet service providers](/wiki/Internet_service_providers \"Internet service providers\") and end-user organizations by the early 1990s, prompted the [Internet Engineering Task Force](/wiki/Internet_Engineering_Task_Force \"Internet Engineering Task Force\") (IETF) to explore new technologies to expand the addressing capability on the Internet. The result was a redesign of the Internet Protocol which became eventually known as [Internet Protocol Version 6](/wiki/IPv6 \"IPv6\") (IPv6) in 1995.[[3]](#cite_note-rfc1883-3)[[4]](#cite_note-rfc2460-4)[[5]](#cite_note-rfc8200-5) IPv6 technology was in various testing stages until the mid-2000s when commercial production deployment commenced.\n\nToday, these two versions of the Internet Protocol are in simultaneous use. Among other technical changes, each version defines the format of addresses differently. Because of the historical prevalence of IPv4, the generic term _IP address_ typically still refers to the addresses defined by IPv4\\. The gap in version sequence between IPv4 and IPv6 resulted from the assignment of version 5 to the experimental [Internet Stream Protocol](/wiki/Internet_Stream_Protocol \"Internet Stream Protocol\") in 1979, which however was never referred to as IPv5.\n\nOther versions v1 to v9 were defined, but only v4 and v6 ever gained widespread use. v1 and v2 were names for [TCP protocols](/wiki/TCP_protocols \"TCP protocols\") in 1974 and 1977, as there was to separate IP specification at the time. v3 was defined in 1978, and v3.1 is the first version where TCP is separated from IP. v6 is a synthesis of several suggested versions, v6 _Simple Internet Protocol_, v7 _TP/IX: The Next Internet_, v8 _PIP — The P Internet Protocol_, and v9 _TUBA — Tcp & Udp with Big Addresses_.[[7]](#cite_note-delong2017-7)\n\n## Subnetworks\n\nIP networks may be divided into [subnetworks](/wiki/Subnetwork \"Subnetwork\") in both [IPv4](/wiki/IPv4_subnetting_reference \"IPv4 subnetting reference\") and [IPv6](/wiki/IPv6_subnetting_reference \"IPv6 subnetting reference\"). For this purpose, an IP address is recognized as consisting of two parts: the _network prefix_ in the high-order bits and the remaining bits called the _rest field_, _host identifier_, or _interface identifier_ (IPv6), used for host numbering within a network.[[1]](#cite_note-rfc760-1) The [subnet mask](/wiki/Subnet_mask \"Subnet mask\") or [CIDR notation](/wiki/CIDR_notation \"CIDR notation\") determines how the IP address is divided into network and host parts.\n\nThe term _subnet mask_ is only used within IPv4\\. Both IP versions however use the CIDR concept and notation. In this, the IP address is followed by a slash and the number (in decimal) of bits used for the network part, also called the _routing prefix_. For example, an IPv4 address and its subnet mask may be _192.0.2.1_ and _255.255.255.0_, respectively. The CIDR notation for the same IP address and subnet is _192.0.2.1/24_, because the first 24 bits of the IP address indicate the network and subnet.\n\n## IPv4 addresses\n\nMain article: [IPv4 § Addressing](/wiki/IPv4#Addressing \"IPv4\")\n\n\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/Ipv4_address.svg/300px-Ipv4_address.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Ipv4_address.svg)\n\n\n\n[](/wiki/File:Ipv4_address.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\nDecomposition of an IPv4 address from [dot-decimal notation](/wiki/Dot-decimal_notation \"Dot-decimal notation\") to its binary value.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn IPv4 address has a size of 32 bits, which limits the [address space](/wiki/Address_space \"Address space\") to 4294967296 (232) addresses. Of this number, some addresses are reserved for special purposes such as [private networks](/wiki/Private_network \"Private network\") (~18 million addresses) and [multicast addressing](/wiki/Multicast_address \"Multicast address\") (~270 million addresses).\n\nIPv4 addresses are usually represented in [dot-decimal notation](/wiki/Dot-decimal_notation \"Dot-decimal notation\"), consisting of four decimal numbers, each ranging from 0 to 255, separated by dots, e.g., _172.16.254.1_. Each part represents a group of 8 bits (an [octet](/wiki/Octet_(computing) \"Octet (computing)\")) of the address. In some cases of technical writing,[_[specify](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources \"Wikipedia:Citing sources\")_] IPv4 addresses may be presented in various [hexadecimal](/wiki/Hexadecimal \"Hexadecimal\"), [octal](/wiki/Octal \"Octal\"), or [binary](/wiki/Binary_numeral_system \"Binary numeral system\") representations.\n\n### Subnetting history\n\nIn the early stages of development of the Internet Protocol, the network number was always the highest order octet (most significant eight bits). Because this method allowed for only 256 networks, it soon proved inadequate as additional networks developed that were independent of the existing networks already designated by a network number. In 1981, the addressing specification was revised with the introduction of [classful network](/wiki/Classful_network \"Classful network\") architecture.[[2]](#cite_note-rfc791-2)\n\nClassful network design allowed for a larger number of individual network assignments and fine-grained subnetwork design. The first three bits of the most significant octet of an IP address were defined as the _class_ of the address. Three classes (_A_, _B_, and _C_) were defined for universal [unicast](/wiki/Unicast \"Unicast\") addressing. Depending on the class derived, the network identification was based on octet boundary segments of the entire address. Each class used successively additional octets in the network identifier, thus reducing the possible number of hosts in the higher order classes (_B_ and _C_). The following table gives an overview of this now obsolete system.\n\nClassful network design served its purpose in the startup stage of the Internet, but it lacked [scalability](/wiki/Scalability \"Scalability\") in the face of the rapid expansion of networking in the 1990s. The class system of the address space was replaced with [Classless Inter-Domain Routing](/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing \"Classless Inter-Domain Routing\") (CIDR) in 1993\\. CIDR is based on variable-length subnet masking (VLSM) to allow allocation and routing based on arbitrary-length prefixes. Today, remnants of classful network concepts function only in a limited scope as the default configuration parameters of some network software and hardware components (e.g. netmask), and in the technical jargon used in network administrators' discussions.\n\n### Private addresses\n\nEarly network design, when global end-to-end connectivity was envisioned for communications with all Internet hosts, intended that IP addresses be globally unique. However, it was found that this was not always necessary as private networks developed and public address space needed to be conserved.\n\nComputers not connected to the Internet, such as factory machines that communicate only with each other via [TCP/IP](/wiki/TCP/IP \"TCP/IP\"), need not have globally unique IP addresses. Today, such private networks are widely used and typically connect to the Internet with [network address translation](/wiki/Network_address_translation \"Network address translation\") (NAT), when needed.\n\nThree non-overlapping ranges of IPv4 addresses for private networks are reserved.[[8]](#cite_note-rfc1918-8) These addresses are not routed on the Internet and thus their use need not be coordinated with an IP address registry. Any user may use any of the reserved blocks. Typically, a network administrator will divide a block into subnets; for example, many [home routers](/wiki/Residential_gateway \"Residential gateway\") automatically use a default address range of _192.168.0.0_ through _192.168.0.255_ (_192.168.0.0/24_).\n\n\n## IPv6 addresses\n\nMain article: [IPv6 address](/wiki/IPv6_address \"IPv6 address\")\n\n\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/Ipv6_address.svg/300px-Ipv6_address.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Ipv6_address.svg)\n\n\n\n[](/wiki/File:Ipv6_address.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\nDecomposition of an IPv6 address from [hexadecimal](/wiki/Hexadecimal \"Hexadecimal\") representation to its binary value.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn IPv6, the address size was increased from 32 bits in IPv4 to 128 bits, thus providing up to 2128 (approximately 3.403×1038) addresses. This is deemed sufficient for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe intent of the new design was not to provide just a sufficient quantity of addresses, but also redesign routing in the Internet by allowing more efficient aggregation of subnetwork routing prefixes. This resulted in slower growth of [routing tables](/wiki/Routing_table \"Routing table\") in routers. The smallest possible individual allocation is a subnet for 264 hosts, which is the square of the size of the entire IPv4 Internet. At these levels, actual address utilization ratios will be small on any IPv6 network segment. The new design also provides the opportunity to separate the addressing infrastructure of a network segment, i.e. the local administration of the segment's available space, from the addressing prefix used to route traffic to and from external networks. IPv6 has facilities that automatically change the routing prefix of entire networks, should the global connectivity or the [routing policy](/wiki/Routing_policy \"Routing policy\") change, without requiring internal redesign or manual renumbering.\n\nThe large number of IPv6 addresses allows large blocks to be assigned for specific purposes and, where appropriate, to be aggregated for efficient routing. With a large address space, there is no need to have complex address conservation methods as used in CIDR.\n\nAll modern desktop and enterprise server operating systems include native support for the [IPv6](/wiki/IPv6 \"IPv6\") protocol, but it is not yet widely deployed in other devices, such as residential networking routers, [voice over IP](/wiki/Voice_over_IP \"Voice over IP\") (VoIP) and multimedia equipment, and some [networking hardware](/wiki/Networking_hardware \"Networking hardware\").\n\n### Private addresses\n\nJust as IPv4 reserves addresses for private networks, blocks of addresses are set aside in IPv6\\. In IPv6, these are referred to as [unique local addresses](/wiki/Unique_local_address \"Unique local address\") (ULAs). The routing prefix _fc00::/7_ is reserved for this block,[[9]](#cite_note-rfc4193-9) which is divided into two _/8_ blocks with different implied policies. The addresses include a 40-bit [pseudorandom](/wiki/Pseudorandomness \"Pseudorandomness\") number that minimizes the risk of address collisions if sites merge or packets are misrouted.\n\nEarly practices used a different block for this purpose (_fec0::_), dubbed site-local addresses.[[10]](#cite_note-rfc3513-10) However, the definition of what constituted a _site_ remained unclear and the poorly defined addressing policy created ambiguities for routing. This address type was abandoned and must not be used in new systems.[[11]](#cite_note-rfc3879-11)\n\nAddresses starting with _fe80::_, called [link-local addresses](/wiki/Link-local_address \"Link-local address\"), are assigned to interfaces for communication on the attached link. The addresses are automatically generated by the operating system for each network interface. This provides instant and automatic communication between all IPv6 hosts on a link. This feature is used in the lower layers of IPv6 network administration, such as for the [Neighbor Discovery Protocol](/wiki/Neighbor_Discovery_Protocol \"Neighbor Discovery Protocol\").\n\nPrivate and link-local address prefixes may not be routed on the public Internet.\n\n## IP address assignment\n\nIP addresses are assigned to a host either dynamically as they join the network, or persistently by configuration of the host hardware or software. Persistent configuration is also known as using a **static IP address**. In contrast, when a computer's IP address is assigned each time it restarts, this is known as using a **dynamic IP address**.\n\nDynamic IP addresses are assigned by network using [Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol](/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol \"Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol\") (DHCP). DHCP is the most frequently used technology for assigning addresses. It avoids the administrative burden of assigning specific static addresses to each device on a network. It also allows devices to share the limited address space on a network if only some of them are online at a particular time. Typically, dynamic IP configuration is enabled by default in modern desktop operating systems.\n\nThe address assigned with DHCP is associated with a _lease_ and usually has an expiration period. If the lease is not renewed by the host before expiry, the address may be assigned to another device. Some DHCP implementations attempt to reassign the same IP address to a host, based on its [MAC address](/wiki/MAC_address \"MAC address\"), each time it joins the network. A network administrator may configure DHCP by allocating specific IP addresses based on MAC address.\n\nDHCP is not the only technology used to assign IP addresses dynamically. [Bootstrap Protocol](/wiki/Bootstrap_Protocol \"Bootstrap Protocol\") is a similar protocol and predecessor to DHCP. [Dialup](/wiki/Dialup \"Dialup\") and some [broadband networks](/wiki/Broadband_networks \"Broadband networks\") use dynamic address features of the [Point-to-Point Protocol](/wiki/Point-to-Point_Protocol \"Point-to-Point Protocol\").\n\nComputers and equipment used for the network infrastructure, such as routers and mail servers, are typically configured with static addressing.\n\nIn the absence or failure of static or dynamic address configurations, an operating system may assign a link-local address to a host using stateless address autoconfiguration.\n\n### Sticky dynamic IP address\n\nA _sticky dynamic IP address_ is an informal term used by cable and DSL Internet access subscribers to describe a dynamically assigned IP address that seldom changes. The addresses are usually assigned with DHCP. Since the modems are usually powered on for extended periods of time, the address leases are usually set to long periods and simply renewed. If a modem is turned off and powered up again before the next expiration of the address lease, it often receives the same IP address.\n\n### Address autoconfiguration\n\nAddress block _169.254.0.0/16_ is defined for the special use in link-local addressing for IPv4 networks.[[12]](#cite_note-rfc6890-12) In IPv6, every interface, whether using static or dynamic address assignments, also receives a link-local address automatically in the block _fe80::/10_.[[12]](#cite_note-rfc6890-12) These addresses are only valid on the link, such as a local network segment or point-to-point connection, to which a host is connected. These addresses are not routable and, like private addresses, cannot be the source or destination of packets traversing the Internet.\n\nWhen the link-local IPv4 address block was reserved, no standards existed for mechanisms of address autoconfiguration. Filling the void, [Microsoft](/wiki/Microsoft \"Microsoft\") developed a protocol called [Automatic Private IP Addressing](/wiki/Automatic_Private_IP_Addressing \"Automatic Private IP Addressing\") (APIPA), whose first public implementation appeared in [Windows 98](/wiki/Windows_98 \"Windows 98\").[[13]](#cite_note-13) APIPA has been deployed on millions of machines and became a [de facto standard](/wiki/De_facto_standard \"De facto standard\") in the industry. In May 2005, the [IETF](/wiki/IETF \"IETF\") defined a formal standard for it.[[14]](#cite_note-rfc3927-14)\n\n### Addressing conflicts\n\nAn IP address conflict occurs when two devices on the same local physical or wireless network claim to have the same IP address. A second assignment of an address generally stops the IP functionality of one or both of the devices. Many modern [operating systems](/wiki/Operating_system \"Operating system\") notify the administrator of IP address conflicts.[[15]](#cite_note-15)[[16]](#cite_note-16) When IP addresses are assigned by multiple people and systems with differing methods, any of them may be at fault.[[17]](#cite_note-17)[[18]](#cite_note-18)[[19]](#cite_note-19)[[20]](#cite_note-20)[[21]](#cite_note-21) If one of the devices involved in the conflict is the [default gateway](/wiki/Default_gateway \"Default gateway\") access beyond the LAN for all devices on the LAN, all devices may be impaired.\n\n## Routing\n\nIP addresses are classified into several classes of operational characteristics: unicast, multicast, anycast and broadcast addressing.\n\n### Unicast addressing\n\nThe most common concept of an IP address is in [unicast](/wiki/Unicast \"Unicast\") addressing, available in both IPv4 and IPv6\\. It normally refers to a single sender or a single receiver, and can be used for both sending and receiving. Usually, a unicast address is associated with a single device or host, but a device or host may have more than one unicast address. Sending the same data to multiple unicast addresses requires the sender to send all the data many times over, once for each recipient.\n\n### Broadcast addressing\n\n[Broadcasting](/wiki/Broadcasting_(computing) \"Broadcasting (computing)\") is an addressing technique available in IPv4 to address data to all possible destinations on a network in one transmission operation as an _all-hosts broadcast_. All receivers capture the network packet. The address _255.255.255.255_ is used for network broadcast. In addition, a more limited directed broadcast uses the all-ones host address with the network prefix. For example, the destination address used for directed broadcast to devices on the network _192.0.2.0/24_ is _192.0.2.255_.\n\nIPv6 does not implement broadcast addressing and replaces it with multicast to the specially defined all-nodes multicast address.\n\n### Multicast addressing\n\nA [multicast address](/wiki/Multicast_address \"Multicast address\") is associated with a group of interested receivers. In IPv4, addresses _224.0.0.0_ through _239.255.255.255_ (the former [Class D](/wiki/Classful_network \"Classful network\") addresses) are designated as multicast addresses.[[22]](#cite_note-rfc5771-22) IPv6 uses the address block with the prefix _ff00::/8_ for multicast. In either case, the sender sends a single [datagram](/wiki/Datagram \"Datagram\") from its unicast address to the multicast group address and the intermediary routers take care of making copies and sending them to all interested receivers (those that have joined the corresponding multicast group).\n\n### Anycast addressing\n\nLike broadcast and multicast, [anycast](/wiki/Anycast \"Anycast\") is a one-to-many routing topology. However, the data stream is not transmitted to all receivers, just the one which the router decides is closest in the network. Anycast addressing is a built-in feature of IPv6.[[23]](#cite_note-23)[[24]](#cite_note-24) In IPv4, anycast addressing is implemented with [Border Gateway Protocol](/wiki/Border_Gateway_Protocol \"Border Gateway Protocol\") using the shortest-path [metric](/wiki/Metrics_(networking) \"Metrics (networking)\") to choose destinations. Anycast methods are useful for global [load balancing](/wiki/Load_balancing_(computing) \"Load balancing (computing)\") and are commonly used in distributed [DNS](/wiki/Domain_name_system \"Domain name system\") systems.\n\n## Geolocation\n\n\n[![[icon]](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg/20px-Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg)\n\n\n\nThis section **needs expansion**. You can help by [adding to it](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=IP_address&action=edit§ion=). _(July 2020)_\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA host may use [geolocation software](/wiki/Geolocation_software \"Geolocation software\") to deduce the [geographic position](/wiki/Geographic_position \"Geographic position\") of its communicating peer.[[25]](#cite_note-oreilly-25)\n\n## Public address\n\nA public IP address, in common parlance, is a globally routable unicast IP address, meaning that the address is not an address reserved for use in [private networks](/wiki/Private_network \"Private network\"), such as those reserved by [RFC](/wiki/RFC_(identifier) \"RFC (identifier)\") [1918](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918), or the various IPv6 address formats of local scope or site-local scope, for example for link-local addressing. Public IP addresses may be used for communication between hosts on the global Internet.\n\n## Firewalling\n\nFor security and privacy considerations, network administrators often desire to restrict public Internet traffic within their private networks. The source and destination IP addresses contained in the headers of each IP packet are a convenient means to discriminate traffic by [IP address blocking](/wiki/IP_address_blocking \"IP address blocking\") or by selectively tailoring responses to external requests to internal servers. This is achieved with [firewall](/wiki/Firewall_(computer) \"Firewall (computer)\") software running on the network's gateway router. A database of IP addresses of restricted and permissible traffic may be maintained in [blacklists](/wiki/Blacklist_(computing) \"Blacklist (computing)\") and [whitelists](/wiki/Whitelist \"Whitelist\"), respectively.\n\n## Address translation\n\nMultiple client devices can appear to share an IP address, either because they are part of a [shared web hosting service](/wiki/Shared_web_hosting_service \"Shared web hosting service\") environment or because an IPv4 [network address translator](/wiki/Network_address_translator \"Network address translator\") (NAT) or [proxy server](/wiki/Proxy_server \"Proxy server\") acts as an [intermediary](/wiki/Intermediary \"Intermediary\") agent on behalf of the client, in which case the real originating IP address is masked from the server receiving a request. A common practice is to have a NAT mask many devices in a private network. Only the public interface(s) of the NAT needs to have an Internet-routable address.[[26]](#cite_note-26)\n\nThe NAT device maps different IP addresses on the private network to different TCP or UDP [port numbers](/wiki/Port_number \"Port number\") on the public network. In residential networks, NAT functions are usually implemented in a [residential gateway](/wiki/Residential_gateway \"Residential gateway\"). In this scenario, the computers connected to the router have private IP addresses and the router has a public address on its external interface to communicate on the Internet. The internal computers appear to share one public IP address.\n\n## Diagnostic tools\n\nComputer operating systems provide various diagnostic tools to examine network interfaces and address configuration. [Microsoft Windows](/wiki/Microsoft_Windows \"Microsoft Windows\") provides the [command-line interface](/wiki/Command-line_interface \"Command-line interface\") tools [ipconfig](/wiki/Ipconfig \"Ipconfig\") and [netsh](/wiki/Netsh \"Netsh\") and users of [Unix-like](/wiki/Unix-like \"Unix-like\") systems may use [ifconfig](/wiki/Ifconfig \"Ifconfig\"), [netstat](/wiki/Netstat \"Netstat\"), [route](/wiki/Route_(command) \"Route (command)\"), lanstat, [fstat](/wiki/Fstat_(Unix) \"Fstat (Unix)\"), and [iproute2](/wiki/Iproute2 \"Iproute2\") utilities to accomplish the task.\n\n## See also\n\n\n\n*   [![icon](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/Crystal_Clear_app_linneighborhood.svg/28px-Crystal_Clear_app_linneighborhood.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Crystal_Clear_app_linneighborhood.svg)[Internet portal](/wiki/Portal:Internet \"Portal:Internet\")\n*   [![icon](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/Octicons-terminal.svg/24px-Octicons-terminal.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Octicons-terminal.svg)[Computer programming portal](/wiki/Portal:Computer_programming \"Portal:Computer programming\")\n\n\n\n\n\n*   [Hostname](/wiki/Hostname \"Hostname\")\n*   [IP address spoofing](/wiki/IP_address_spoofing \"IP address spoofing\")\n*   [IP aliasing](/wiki/IP_aliasing \"IP aliasing\")\n*   [IP multicast](/wiki/IP_multicast \"IP multicast\")\n*   [List of assigned /8 IPv4 address blocks](/wiki/List_of_assigned_/8_IPv4_address_blocks \"List of assigned /8 IPv4 address blocks\")\n*   [Reverse DNS lookup](/wiki/Reverse_DNS_lookup \"Reverse DNS lookup\")\n*   [Virtual IP address](/wiki/Virtual_IP_address \"Virtual IP address\")\n*   [WHOIS](/wiki/WHOIS \"WHOIS\")\n\n\n\n## References\n\n\n\n\n\n1.  ^ [Jump up to: _**a**_](#cite_ref-rfc760_1-0) [_**b**_](#cite_ref-rfc760_1-1) [RFC 760](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc760), _DOD Standard Internet Protocol_, DARPA, Information Sciences Institute (January 1980).\n2.  ^ [Jump up to: _**a**_](#cite_ref-rfc791_2-0) [_**b**_](#cite_ref-rfc791_2-1) [_**c**_](#cite_ref-rfc791_2-2) [_**d**_](#cite_ref-rfc791_2-3) [J.

SignalR takes advantage of [WebSocket](/wiki/WebSocket \"WebSocket\"), an [HTML5](/wiki/HTML5 \"HTML5\") API that enables bi-directional communication between the browser and server.

While both terms may apply to a particular act, they are different concepts, and false claims of authorship generally constitute plagiarism regardless of whether the material is protected by copyright. Copyright infringement is a violation of the rights of a copyright holder, when material whose use is restricted by copyright is used without consent. Plagiarism, in contrast, is concerned with the unearned increment to the plagiarizing author's reputation, or the obtaining of academic credit, that is achieved through false claims of authorship. Thus, plagiarism is considered a moral offense against the plagiarist's audience (for example, a reader, listener, or teacher).\n\nPlagiarism is also considered a moral offense against anyone who has provided the plagiarist with a benefit in exchange for what is specifically supposed to be original content (for example, the plagiarist's publisher, employer, or teacher). In such cases, acts of plagiarism may sometimes also form part of a claim for [breach](/wiki/Breach_of_contract \"Breach of contract\") of the plagiarist's contract, or, if done knowingly, for a [civil wrong](/wiki/Civil_wrong \"Civil wrong\").\n\n## In academia and journalism[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Plagiarism&action=edit§ion=3 \"Edit section: In academia and journalism\")]\n\nWithin [academia](/wiki/Academia \"Academia\"), plagiarism by students, professors, or researchers is considered [academic dishonesty](/wiki/Academic_dishonesty \"Academic dishonesty\") or academic fraud, and offenders are subject to academic censure, up to and including [expulsion](/wiki/Expulsion_(academia) \"Expulsion (academia)\"). Some institutions use [plagiarism detection software](/wiki/Plagiarism_detection \"Plagiarism detection\") to uncover potential plagiarism and to deter students from plagiarizing. However, plagiarism detection software doesn't always yield accurate results and there are loopholes in these systems.[[38]](#cite_note-38) Some universities address the issue of academic integrity by providing students with thorough orientations, required writing courses, and clearly articulated honor codes.[[39]](#cite_note-aboutcampus-39) Indeed, there is a virtually uniform understanding among college students that plagiarism is wrong.[[39]](#cite_note-aboutcampus-39) Nevertheless, each year students are brought before their institutions’ disciplinary boards on charges that they have misused sources in their schoolwork.\"[[39]](#cite_note-aboutcampus-39) However, the practice of plagiarizing by use of sufficient word substitutions to elude detection software, known as [rogeting](/wiki/Rogeting \"Rogeting\"), has rapidly evolved as students and unethical academics seek to stay ahead of detection software.[[40]](#cite_note-Grove-40)\n\nAn extreme form of plagiarism, known as [contract cheating](/wiki/Contract_cheating \"Contract cheating\") involves students paying someone else, such as an [essay mill](/wiki/Essay_mill \"Essay mill\"), to do their work for them.[[35]](#cite_note-link.springer.com-35)\n\nIn [journalism](/wiki/Journalism \"Journalism\"), plagiarism is considered a breach of [journalistic ethics](/wiki/Journalistic_ethics \"Journalistic ethics\"), and reporters caught plagiarizing typically face disciplinary measures ranging from suspension to termination of employment.[[41]](#cite_note-41) Some individuals caught plagiarizing in academic or journalistic contexts claim that they plagiarized unintentionally, by failing to include [quotations](/wiki/Quotation \"Quotation\") or give the appropriate [citation](/wiki/Citation \"Citation\"). While plagiarism in scholarship and journalism has a centuries-old history, the development of the [Internet](/wiki/Internet \"Internet\"), where articles appear as electronic text, has made the physical act of copying the work of others much easier.[[42]](#cite_note-42)\n\nPredicated upon an expected level of learning/comprehension having been achieved, all associated academic accreditation becomes seriously undermined if plagiarism is allowed to become the norm within academic submissions.[[43]](#cite_note-43)\n\nFor professors and researchers, plagiarism is punished by sanctions ranging from suspension to termination, along with the loss of credibility and perceived integrity.[[44]](#cite_note-44)[[45]](#cite_note-45) Charges of plagiarism against students and professors are typically heard by internal disciplinary committees, by which students and professors have agreed to be bound.[[46]](#cite_note-46) Plagiarism is a common reason for academic research papers to be retracted.[[47]](#cite_note-47)\n\n### Academia[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Plagiarism&action=edit§ion=4 \"Edit section: Academia\")]\n\n\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Example-of-Article-Plagiarism-Diagram.png/220px-Example-of-Article-Plagiarism-Diagram.png)](/wiki/File:Example-of-Article-Plagiarism-Diagram.png)\n\n\n\n[](/wiki/File:Example-of-Article-Plagiarism-Diagram.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nOne form of academic plagiarism involves appropriating a published article and modifying it slightly to avoid suspicion.\n\n\n\n\n\nNo universally adopted definition of academic plagiarism exists[[3]](#cite_note-:2-3) however, this section provides several definitions to exemplify the most common characteristics of academic plagiarism. It has been called, \"The use of ideas, concepts, words, or structures without appropriately acknowledging the source to benefit in a setting where originality is expected.\"[[48]](#cite_note-Gipp14-48)\n\nThis is an abridged version of Teddi Fishman's definition of plagiarism, which proposed five elements characteristic of plagiarism.[[49]](#cite_note-Fishman09-49) According to Fishman, plagiarism occurs when someone:\n\n1.  Uses words, ideas, or work products\n2.  Attributable to another identifiable person or source\n3.  Without attributing the work to the source from which it was obtained\n4.  In a situation in which there is a legitimate expectation of original authorship\n5.  In order to obtain some benefit, credit, or gain which need not be monetary[[49]](#cite_note-Fishman09-49)\n\nFurthermore, plagiarism is defined differently among institutions of higher learning and universities:\n\n*   [Stanford](/wiki/Stanford_University \"Stanford University\") defines plagiarism as the \"use, without giving reasonable and appropriate credit to or acknowledging the author or source, of another person's original work, whether such work is made up of code, formulas, ideas, language, research, strategies, writing or other form.\"[[50]](#cite_note-50)\n*   [Yale](/wiki/Yale_University \"Yale University\") views plagiarism as the \"... use of another's work, words, or ideas without attribution,\" which includes \"... using a source's language without quoting, using information from a source without attribution, and paraphrasing a source in a form that stays too close to the original.\"[[51]](#cite_note-51)\n*   [Princeton](/wiki/Princeton_University \"Princeton University\") describes plagiarism as the \"deliberate\" use of \"someone else's language, ideas, or other original (not common-knowledge) material without acknowledging its source.\"[[52]](#cite_note-52)\n*   [Oxford College of Emory University](/wiki/Oxford_College_of_Emory_University \"Oxford College of Emory University\") characterizes plagiarism as the use of \"a writer's ideas or phraseology without giving due credit.\"[[53]](#cite_note-53)\n*   [Brown](/wiki/Brown_University \"Brown University\") defines plagiarism as \"... appropriating another person's ideas or words (spoken or written) without attributing those word or ideas to their true source.\"[[54]](#cite_note-54)\n*   [The U.S. Naval Academy](/wiki/United_States_Naval_Academy \"United States Naval Academy\") defines plagiarism as \"the use of the words, information, insights, or ideas of another without crediting that person through proper citation.\"[[55]](#cite_note-55)\n\n#### Forms of academic plagiarism[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Plagiarism&action=edit§ion=5 \"Edit section: Forms of academic plagiarism\")]\n\nDifferent classifications of academic plagiarism forms have been proposed. Many classifications follow a behavioral approach, i.e., they seek to classify the actions undertaken by plagiarists.\n\nFor example, a 2015 survey of teachers and professors by [Turnitin](/wiki/Turnitin \"Turnitin\"),[[56]](#cite_note-56) identified 10 main forms of plagiarism that students commit:\n\n1.  Submitting someone's work as their own.\n2.  Taking passages from their own previous work without adding citations (self-plagiarism).\n3.  Re-writing someone's work without properly citing sources.\n4.  Using quotations but not citing the source.\n5.  Interweaving various sources together in the work without citing.\n6.  Citing some, but not all, passages that should be cited.\n7.  Melding together cited and uncited sections of the piece.\n8.  Providing proper citations, but failing to change the structure and wording of the borrowed ideas enough (close paraphrasing).\n9.  Inaccurately citing a source.\n10.  Relying too heavily on other people's work, failing to bring original thought into the text.\n\nA 2019 [systematic literature review](/wiki/Systematic_review \"Systematic review\") on academic [plagiarism detection](/wiki/Plagiarism_detection \"Plagiarism detection\")[[57]](#cite_note-57) deductively derived a technically oriented typology of academic plagiarism from the linguistic model of language consisting of [lexis](/wiki/Lexis_(linguistics) \"Lexis (linguistics)\"), [syntax](/wiki/Syntax \"Syntax\"), and [semantics](/wiki/Semantics \"Semantics\") extended by a fourth layer to capture the plagiarism of ideas and structures. The typology categorizes plagiarism forms according to the layer of the model they affect:\n\n*   Characters-preserving plagiarism\n    *   Verbatim copying without proper citation\n*   Syntax-preserving plagiarism\n    *   Synonym substitution\n    *   Technical disguise (e.g. using identically looking [glyphs](/wiki/Glyph \"Glyph\") from another [alphabet](/wiki/Alphabet \"Alphabet\"))\n*   Semantics-preserving plagiarism\n    *   Translation\n    *   [Paraphrase](/wiki/Paraphrase \"Paraphrase\")\n*   Idea-preserving plagiarism\n    *   Appropriation of ideas or concepts\n    *   Reusing text structure\n*   Ghostwriting\n    *   [Collusion](/wiki/Collusion \"Collusion\") (typically among students)\n    *   [Contract cheating](/wiki/Contract_cheating \"Contract cheating\")\n\n#### Sanctions for student plagiarism[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Plagiarism&action=edit§ion=6 \"Edit section: Sanctions for student plagiarism\")]\n\nIn the academic world, plagiarism by students is usually considered a very serious offense that can result in punishments such as a failing grade on the particular assignment, the entire course, or even being expelled from the institution.[[15]](#cite_note-bbc.com-15) The seriousness with which academic institutions address student plagiarism may be tempered by a recognition that students may not fully understand what plagiarism is. A 2015 study showed that students who were new to university study did not have a good understanding of even the basic requirements of how to attribute sources in written academic work, yet students were very confident that they understood what referencing and plagiarism are.[[58]](#cite_note-58) The same students also had a lenient view of how plagiarism should be penalised.\n\nFor cases of repeated plagiarism, or for cases in which a student commits severe plagiarism (e.g., purchasing an assignment), suspension or [expulsion](/wiki/Expulsion_(education) \"Expulsion (education)\") may occur. There has been historic concern about inconsistencies in penalties administered for university student plagiarism, and a plagiarism tariff was devised in 2008 for UK higher education institutions in an attempt to encourage some standardization of approaches.[[59]](#cite_note-59)\n\nHowever, to impose sanctions, plagiarism needs to be detected. Strategies faculty members use to detect plagiarism include carefully reading students work and making note of inconsistencies in student writing, citation errors and providing plagiarism prevention education to students.[[60]](#cite_note-:0-60) It has been found that a significant share of (university) teachers do not use detection methods such as using text-matching software.[[61]](#cite_note-Sattler2015-61) A few more try to detect plagiarism by reading term-papers specifically for plagiarism, while the latter method might be not very effective in detecting plagiarism – especially when plagiarism from unfamiliar sources needs to be detected.[[61]](#cite_note-Sattler2015-61) There are checklists of tactics to prevent student plagiarism.[[62]](#cite_note-62)\n\n#### Plagiarism education[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Plagiarism&action=edit§ion=7 \"Edit section: Plagiarism education\")]\n\nGiven the serious consequences that plagiarism has for students, there has been a call for a greater emphasis on learning in order to help students avoid committing plagiarism.[[63]](#cite_note-ireland-63)[[64]](#cite_note-64)[[65]](#cite_note-65) This is especially important when students move to a new institution that may have a different view of the concept when compared with the view previously developed by the student.[[66]](#cite_note-byrne-66) Indeed, given the seriousness of plagiarism accusations for a student's future, the pedagogy of plagiarism education may need to be considered ahead of the pedagogy of the discipline being studied.[[63]](#cite_note-ireland-63) The need for plagiarism education extends to academic staff, who may not completely understand what is expected of their students or the consequences of misconduct.[[67]](#cite_note-67)[[60]](#cite_note-:0-60)[[68]](#cite_note-68)\n\n#### Factors influencing students' decision to plagiarize[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Plagiarism&action=edit§ion=8 \"Edit section: Factors influencing students' decision to plagiarize\")]\n\nSeveral studies investigated factors that influence the decision to plagiarize. For example, a panel study with students from German universities found that academic procrastination predicts the frequency plagiarism conducted within six months followed the measurement of academic procrastination.[[69]](#cite_note-69) It has been argued that by plagiarizing students cope with the negative consequences that result from academic procrastination such as poor grades. Another study found that plagiarism is more frequent if students perceive plagiarism as beneficial and if they have the opportunity to plagiarize.[[70]](#cite_note-70) When students had expected higher sanctions and when they had internalized social norms that define plagiarism as very objectionable, plagiarism was less likely to occur. Another study found that students resorted to plagiarism in order to cope with heavy workloads imposed by teachers. On the other hand, in that study, some teachers also thought that plagiarism is a consequence of their own failure to propose creative tasks and activities.[[71]](#cite_note-71)\n\n### Journalism[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Plagiarism&action=edit§ion=9 \"Edit section: Journalism\")]\n\nSince journalism relies on the public trust, a reporter's failure to honestly acknowledge their sources undercuts a newspaper or television news show's integrity and undermines its credibility. Journalists accused of plagiarism are often suspended from their reporting tasks while the charges are being investigated by the news organization.[[72]](#cite_note-72)\n\n### Self-plagiarism[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Plagiarism&action=edit§ion=10 \"Edit section: Self-plagiarism\")]\n\nSee also: [Duplicate publication](/wiki/Duplicate_publication \"Duplicate publication\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a7/Split-arrows.svg/50px-Split-arrows.svg.png)\n\n\n\n\n\nIt has been suggested that this section be [split](/wiki/Wikipedia:Splitting \"Wikipedia:Splitting\") out into another article titled _[Self-plagiarism](/wiki/Self-plagiarism \"Self-plagiarism\")_. ([Discuss](/wiki/Talk:Plagiarism#January_2013_proposal_to_split_off_'self-plagiarism' \"Talk:Plagiarism\")) _(April 2020)_\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reuse of significant, identical, or nearly identical portions of one's own work without acknowledging that one is doing so or citing the original work is sometimes described as \"self-plagiarism\"; the term \"recycling fraud\" has also been used to describe this practice.[[73]](#cite_note-73) Articles of this nature are often referred to as duplicate or [multiple publication](/wiki/Multiple_publication \"Multiple publication\"). In addition there can be a copyright issue if copyright of the prior work has been transferred to another entity. Self-plagiarism is considered a serious ethical issue in settings where someone asserts that a publication consists of new material, such as in publishing or factual documentation.[[74]](#cite_note-74) It does not apply to public-interest texts, such as social, professional, and cultural opinions usually published in newspapers and magazines.[[75]](#cite_note-75)\n\nIn academic fields, self-plagiarism occurs when an author reuses portions of their own published and copyrighted work in subsequent publications, but without attributing the previous publication.[[76]](#cite_note-76)[[77]](#cite_note-:1-77) Identifying self-plagiarism is often difficult because limited reuse of material is accepted both legally (as [fair use](/wiki/Fair_use \"Fair use\")) and ethically.[[78]](#cite_note-Samuelson,_Pamela._(1994)-78) Many people mostly, but not limited to [critics of copyright](/wiki/Opposition_to_copyright \"Opposition to copyright\") and [\"intellectual property\"](/wiki/Criticism_of_intellectual_property \"Criticism of intellectual property\") do not believe it is possible to plagiarize oneself.[[79]](#cite_note-poynter.org-79) Those critical of the concept of Plagiarism,[[80]](#cite_note-80) or strive for the [abolition of copyright](/wiki/Abolition_of_copyright \"Abolition of copyright\") itself use the concept of self-plagiarism as a [reductio ad absurdum](/wiki/Reductio_ad_absurdum \"Reductio ad absurdum\") argument.\n\n#### Contested definition[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Plagiarism&action=edit§ion=11 \"Edit section: Contested definition\")]\n\nMiguel Roig has written at length about the topic of self-plagiarism[[77]](#cite_note-:1-77)[[81]](#cite_note-81)[[82]](#cite_note-82)[[83]](#cite_note-83) and his definition of self-plagiarism as using previously disseminated work is widely accepted among scholars of the topic. However, the term \"self-plagiarism\" has been challenged as being self-contradictory, an [oxymoron](/wiki/Oxymoron \"Oxymoron\"),[[84]](#cite_note-84) and on other grounds.[[85]](#cite_note-85)\n\nFor example, Stephanie J. Bird[[86]](#cite_note-86) argues that self-plagiarism is a misnomer, since by definition plagiarism concerns the use of others' material. Bird identifies the ethical issues of \"self-plagiarism\" as those of \"dual or redundant publication\". She also notes that in an educational context, \"self-plagiarism\" refers to the case of a student who resubmits \"the same essay for credit in two different courses.\" As David B. Resnik clarifies, \"Self-plagiarism involves dishonesty but not intellectual theft.\"[[87]](#cite_note-87)\n\nAccording to Patrick M. Scanlon,[[88]](#cite_note-88) \"self-plagiarism\" is a term with some specialized currency. Most prominently, it is used in discussions of research and publishing integrity in biomedicine, where heavy publish-or-perish demands have led to a rash of duplicate and \"salami-slicing\" publication, the reporting of a single study's results in \"[least publishable units](/wiki/Least_publishable_unit \"Least publishable unit\")\" within multiple articles (Blancett, Flanagin, & Young, 1995; Jefferson, 1998; Kassirer & Angell, 1995; Lowe, 2003; McCarthy, 1993; Schein & Paladugu, 2001; Wheeler, 1989). Roig (2002) offers a useful classification system including four types of self-plagiarism: duplicate publication of an article in more than one journal; partitioning of one study into multiple publications, often called salami-slicing; text recycling; and copyright infringement.\n\n#### Codes of ethics[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Plagiarism&action=edit§ion=12 \"Edit section: Codes of ethics\")]\n\nSome academic journals have codes of ethics that specifically refer to self-plagiarism. For example, the _Journal of International Business Studies_.[[89]](#cite_note-89) Some professional organizations like the [Association for Computing Machinery](/wiki/Association_for_Computing_Machinery \"Association for Computing Machinery\") (ACM) have created policies that deal specifically with self-plagiarism.[[90]](#cite_note-90) Other organizations do not make specific reference to self-plagiarism such as the American Political Science Association (APSA). The organization published a code of ethics that describes plagiarism as \"...deliberate appropriation of the works of others represented as one's own.\" It does not make any reference to self-plagiarism. It does say that when a thesis or dissertation is published \"in whole or in part\", the author is \"not ordinarily under an ethical obligation to acknowledge its origins.\"[[91]](#cite_note-91) The American Society for Public Administration (ASPA) also published a code of ethics that says its members are committed to: \"Ensure that others receive credit for their work and contributions,\" but it makes no reference to self-plagiarism.[[92]](#cite_note-92)\n\n#### Factors that justify reuse[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Plagiarism&action=edit§ion=13 \"Edit section: Factors that justify reuse\")]\n\n[Pamela Samuelson](/wiki/Pamela_Samuelson \"Pamela Samuelson\"), in 1994, identified several factors she says excuse reuse of one's previously published work, that make it not self-plagiarism.[[78]](#cite_note-Samuelson,_Pamela._(1994)-78) She relates each of these factors specifically to the ethical issue of self-plagiarism, as distinct from the legal issue of fair use of copyright, which she deals with separately. Among other factors that may excuse reuse of previously published material Samuelson lists the following:\n\n1.  The previous work must be restated to lay the groundwork for a new contribution in the second work.\n2.  Portions of the previous work must be repeated to deal with new evidence or arguments.\n3.  The audience for each work is so different that publishing the same work in different places is necessary to get the message out.\n4.  The author thinks they said it so well the first time that it makes no sense to say it differently a second time.\n\nSamuelson states she has relied on the \"different audience\" rationale when attempting to bridge interdisciplinary communities. She refers to writing for different legal and technical communities, saying: \"there are often paragraphs or sequences of paragraphs that can be bodily lifted from one article to the other. And, in truth, I lift them.\" She refers to her own practice of converting \"a technical article into a law review article with relatively few changes—adding footnotes and one substantive section\" for a different audience.[[78]](#cite_note-Samuelson,_Pamela._(1994)-78)\n\nSamuelson describes misrepresentation as the basis of self-plagiarism.[[78]](#cite_note-Samuelson,_Pamela._(1994)-78) She also states \"Although it seems not to have been raised in any of the self-plagiarism cases, copyrights law's fair use defense would likely provide a shield against many potential publisher claims of copyright infringement against authors who reused portions of their previous works.\"[[78]](#cite_note-Samuelson,_Pamela._(1994)-78)\n\n### Organizational publications[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Plagiarism&action=edit§ion=14 \"Edit section: Organizational publications\")]\n\nPlagiarism is presumably not an issue when organizations issue collective unsigned works since they do not assign credit for originality to particular people. For example, the [American Historical Association](/wiki/American_Historical_Association \"American Historical Association\")'s \"Statement on Standards of Professional Conduct\" (2005) regarding textbooks and reference books states that, since textbooks and encyclopedias are summaries of other scholars' work, they are not bound by the same exacting standards of attribution as original research and may be allowed a greater \"extent of dependence\" on other works.[[93]](#cite_note-AHA-93) However, even such a book does not make use of words, phrases, or paragraphs from another text or follow too closely the other text's arrangement and organization, and the authors of such texts are also expected to \"acknowledge the sources of recent or distinctive findings and interpretations, those not yet a part of the common understanding of the profession.\"[[93]](#cite_note-AHA-93)\n\n## In the arts[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Plagiarism&action=edit§ion=15 \"Edit section: In the arts\")]\n\n### The history of the arts[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Plagiarism&action=edit§ion=16 \"Edit section: The history of the arts\")]\n\n\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cc/Hiroshige_Van_Gogh_1.JPG/280px-Hiroshige_Van_Gogh_1.JPG)](/wiki/File:Hiroshige_Van_Gogh_1.JPG)\n\n\n\n[](/wiki/File:Hiroshige_Van_Gogh_1.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\nComparison of a woodblock print by [Hiroshige](/wiki/Hiroshige \"Hiroshige\") (left) to its [copy](/wiki/Copies_by_Vincent_van_Gogh \"Copies by Vincent van Gogh\") by [Vincent van Gogh](/wiki/Vincent_van_Gogh \"Vincent van Gogh\")\n\n\n\n\n\nThrough all of the [history of literature](/wiki/History_of_literature \"History of literature\") and [of the arts](/wiki/History_of_art \"History of art\") in general, works of art are for a large part repetitions of the [tradition](/wiki/Poetic_tradition \"Poetic tradition\"); to the entire history of [artistic creativity](/wiki/Artistic_creativity \"Artistic creativity\") belong plagiarism, literary theft, [appropriation](/wiki/Appropriation_(art) \"Appropriation (art)\"), incorporation, retelling, rewriting, recapitulation, revision, reprise, [thematic variation](/wiki/Thematic_variation \"Thematic variation\"), ironic retake, [parody](/wiki/Parody \"Parody\"), imitation, stylistic theft, [pastiches](/wiki/Pastiche \"Pastiche\"), [collages](/wiki/Collage \"Collage\"), and deliberate [assemblages](/wiki/Assemblage_(art) \"Assemblage (art)\").[[94]](#cite_note-Derrida01p57-94)[[95]](#cite_note-Eco90-95)[[36]](#cite_note-Lands99-36)[[96]](#cite_note-Alfrey-96)[[97]](#cite_note-97)[[98]](#cite_note-Steiner98pp437-459-98) There is no rigorous and precise distinction between practices like imitation, stylistic plagiarism, [copy](/wiki/Copying \"Copying\"), [replica](/wiki/Replica \"Replica\") and [forgery](/wiki/Forgery \"Forgery\").[[94]](#cite_note-Derrida01p57-94)[[99]](#cite_note-Haywood87p109Arnau-99)[[100]](#cite_note-Eco87p202Arnau-100)[[101]](#cite_note-Arnau59p40-101) These appropriation procedures are the main axis of a literate culture, in which the tradition of the canonic past is being constantly rewritten.[[98]](#cite_note-Steiner98pp437-459-98)\n\nRuth Graham quotes [T.

Bad poets deface what they take.\"—she notes that despite the \"taboo\" of plagiarism, the ill-will and embarrassment it causes in the modern context, readers seem to often forgive the past excesses of historic literary offenders.[[102]](#cite_note-102)\n\n### Praisings of artistic plagiarism[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Plagiarism&action=edit§ion=17 \"Edit section: Praisings of artistic plagiarism\")]\n\nA passage of [Laurence Sterne](/wiki/Laurence_Sterne \"Laurence Sterne\")'s 1767 _[Tristram Shandy](/wiki/Tristram_Shandy \"Tristram Shandy\")_ condemns plagiarism by resorting to plagiarism.[[103]](#cite_note-103) [Oliver Goldsmith](/wiki/Oliver_Goldsmith \"Oliver Goldsmith\") commented:\n\n> Sterne's Writings, in which it is clearly shewn, that he, whose manner and style were so long thought original, was, in fact, the most unhesitating plagiarist who ever cribbed from his predecessors in order to garnish his own pages. It must be owned, at the same time, that Sterne selects the materials of his mosaic work with so much art, places them so well, and polishes them so highly, that in most cases we are disposed to pardon the want of originality, in consideration of the exquisite talent with which the borrowed materials are wrought up into the new form.[[104]](#cite_note-104)\n\n## In other contexts[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Plagiarism&action=edit§ion=18 \"Edit section: In other contexts\")]\n\n### On the Internet[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Plagiarism&action=edit§ion=19 \"Edit section: On the Internet\")]\n\nFree online tools are becoming available to help identify plagiarism,[[105]](#cite_note-105)[[106]](#cite_note-106) and there are a range of approaches that attempt to limit online copying, such as [disabling](/wiki/Digital_rights_management \"Digital rights management\") [right clicking](/wiki/Right-click#Common_mouse_operations \"Right-click\") and placing warning banners regarding copyrights on web pages.
